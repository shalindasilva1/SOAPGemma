"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Hi, I don't have any past medical history.
Doctor: Okay. What brings you in today?
Patient: I've been experiencing painless blurry vision in my right eye for a week now. I've also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity?
Patient: No, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.
Doctor: Do you work with any toxic substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?
Patient: No, I work as a flooring installer and I don't have any toxic habits.
Doctor: Alright. We checked your vital signs and they were normal. During the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than in your left eye. You also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. We also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. You have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. You also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 33 mm/hr, and your C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at 13.3 mg/L. Your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.
Patient: Okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: These results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. We also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. In the meantime, we'll monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. We'll keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.
Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.","S: The patient, a flooring installer with no significant past medical history, presents with painless blurry vision in the right eye for one week, intermittent fevers, headaches, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the lower legs for six months. The patient also reports an isolated episode of left knee and testicular swelling in the past but denies any neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity. No history of exposure to toxic substances or habits related to smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use.
O: Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals bilateral papilledema, greater optic nerve erythema in the right eye, a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect, and a right afferent pupillary defect. Muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception are intact. A maculopapular rash is noted on bilateral lower extremities. Lab findings include microcytic anemia (Hemoglobin: 11.6 gm/dL, Hematocrit: 35.3%, MCV: 76.9 fL), hyponatremia (Sodium: 133 mmol/L), elevated ESR (33 mm/hr), and CRP (13.3 mg/L). Urinalysis is normal. Lumbar puncture shows clear fluid, 2 RBCs/µL, and 56 WBCs/µL.
A: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process affecting multiple systems, including the central nervous system, as indicated by papilledema and abnormal lumbar puncture results. Differential diagnoses could include autoimmune conditions, infectious diseases, or other systemic inflammatory disorders.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 7-year-old boy with congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness, and you've had a failed right cochlear implant. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, doctor.
Doctor: We recently conducted a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) before transferring you to the operating theatre for an ABI insertion. During the MRI, your airway was secured with a size 5.5 mm internal-diameter uncuffed ETT. Did you experience any discomfort during the MRI?
Patient: No, it was okay.
Doctor: Great. Now, during the surgery, we will be performing intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring, which includes brainstem auditory sensory evoked potentials, brainstem mapping of CN IX, X, XI, XII and their motor nuclei, and corticobulbar tract motor-evoked potential (MEP). This will help us monitor your nerves during the procedure.
Patient: Okay, doctor.
Doctor: Our anesthesia team will be responsible for the lead placement for CN IX, X, XI, XII. We will use a 32 mm by 29 mm laryngeal electrode for CN X monitoring (Fig.). To ensure optimal electrode placement on the tracheal tube, we positioned you as intended for surgery (right lateral) and identified the depth of ETT corresponding to the laryngeal inlet using a C-MAC Laryngoscope.
Patient: Hmm, alright.
Doctor: This corresponded to 6 cm at vocal cords (15 cm at lips). We then prepared a new #5.5 uncuffed ETT with the laryngeal electrodes (Fig.) and re-intubated you, in keeping with the measurements. 
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: For CN IX placement, we put a pin electrode on the ipsilateral soft palate. For CN XII, we placed electrodes on the anterior tongue. 
Patient: I see.
Doctor: To stabilize the tracheal tube, we used rolled up gauzes on either side of it (Fig.), which also acted as a bite block.
Patient: Alright, doctor.
Doctor: During the surgery, we will administer Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) which includes propofol (Paedsfusor Target Control Infusion, target plasma concentration 3.5–5.0 mcg/ml) and remifentanil (0.08–0.3 mcg/kg/min).
Patient: Will I feel any pain during the surgery?
Doctor: No, the anesthesia will ensure that you remain comfortable and pain-free throughout the procedure.
Patient: That's good to know.
Doctor: After the surgery, we will closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary follow-up care. It's important that you follow our instructions to ensure the best possible outcome.
Patient: Yes, doctor. I will.
Doctor: Great. If you or your family have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

"Doctor: Hello, we've received your results from the ultrasound we performed in April 2017. It seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. We also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.
Patient: Hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?
Doctor: Your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ng/mL. To further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.
Patient: And what did the stimulation test show?
Doctor: After the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. As a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.
Patient: Yes, I remember that. How was my recovery after the surgery?
Doctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. However, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.
Patient: That's good to hear. What did the tests on the removed tissue show?
Doctor: Immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) measuring 1 cm. It is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.
Patient: What about the other surrounding tissue?
Doctor: Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. However, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.
Patient: That's a relief. What other tests were done on the tissue?
Doctor: To perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high pH. They were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.
Patient: So, what does this all mean for my condition?
Doctor: Overall, these results confirm the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Fortunately, none of the lymph nodes showed signs of metastases, which is a positive sign. It's important to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring to ensure proper management of your condition.","S: The patient reported undergoing an ultrasound in April 2017, which identified a thyroid nodule in the left lobe. The patient underwent biochemical screening, including TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin levels, which showed elevated calcitonin. A stimulation test with intravenous calcium indicated significantly elevated calcitonin levels, leading to a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. Post-surgery, the patient experienced transient hypocalcemia but recovered within 48 hours. The patient inquired about the recovery and results of the tissue tests post-surgery.
O: Ultrasound revealed a 1 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. Initial calcitonin level was 40 ng/mL (normal range 1-4.8 ng/mL). Post-stimulation, calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL. Postoperative recovery included slight hypocalcemia, resolving in 48 hours. Immunohistochemistry of the thyroid nodule confirmed medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), 1 cm in size, with cells positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, and negative for amyloid. No lymph node metastases were found. Additional tissue analysis involved antigen retrieval and immunolabeling confirming MTC.
A: The primary diagnosis is medullary thyroid cancer, confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the thyroid nodule and absence of metastasis in lymph nodes. The patient's elevated calcitonin levels and the results of the stimulation test supported the need for surgical intervention, which was successfully performed without complications.
P: The patient will continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any recurrence or progression of medullary thyroid cancer.

It seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. We also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.\nPatient: Hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?\nDoctor: Your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ng/mL. To further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.\nPatient: And what did the stimulation test show?\nDoctor: After the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. As a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. How was my recovery after the surgery?\nDoctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. However, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What did the tests on the removed tissue show?\nDoctor: Immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) measuring 1 cm. It is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.\nPatient: What about the other surrounding tissue?\nDoctor: Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. However, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.\nPatient: That's a relief. What other tests were done on the tissue?\nDoctor: To perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high pH. They were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.\nPatient: So, what does this all mean for my condition?\nDoctor: Overall, these results confirm the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Fortunately, none of the lymph nodes showed signs of metastases, which is a positive sign. It's important to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring to ensure proper management of your condition.""}

"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me what brought you here today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having a progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week. I also noticed some right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia.
Doctor: I see. Let's talk about when you first presented with these symptoms. Did you experience any conscious disturbance?
Patient: Yes, I had an acute onset conscious disturbance, and my Glasgow Coma Scale was E3VaM5 at the hospital.
Doctor: Okay, we performed a brain computed tomography and found an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic changes. The tumor is located in your left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it's a serious condition. We performed an emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in December 2006. The pathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic GBM.
Patient: What happened after that?
Doctor: You underwent radiotherapy a month later, followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for six months. Your performance status improved to a Karnofsky Grade of 70, and your clinical condition was stable thereafter.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: However, a follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in June 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion, about 1.1 cm in diameter, at your left temporal base. The brain MRI in October 2014 showed a progressive change in lesions, with a maximum of 3.0 cm in diameter.
Patient: What did you do about that?
Doctor: We performed another surgery for gross tumor removal. Histologically, the tumors showed the oligodendroglial component. Neoplastic cells also showed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) negativity as revealed by immunostaining.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: During your follow-up, we noticed signs of increased intracranial pressure in May 2015. As a result, you received a third debulking surgery.
Patient: What did the third pathology reveal?
Doctor: The third pathology revealed both GBM- and PNET-like components. In immunohistochemistry, the PNET-like component exhibited positivity for synaptophysin and CD56 and focal weak positivity for glial fibrillary.
Patient: What's the next step for my treatment?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide further treatment options as needed. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure the best possible care.
Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help.","S: The patient reports a progressive headache, nausea, vomiting, right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia for about a week. The patient also experienced an acute onset of conscious disturbance, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of E3VaM5.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you have been dealing with hepatocellular carcinoma and had a liver transplantation from a living donor about a year ago. How have you been feeling recently?
Patient: Well, lately I developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day). How has your pain been since then?
Patient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful.
Doctor: I see. In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.
Doctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?
Patient: The patch has been helpful; I've noticed a difference.
Doctor: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 μg/day. We have been gradually decreasing the dose daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day). As your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms. The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms. How are you feeling now?
Patient: I'm feeling much better now, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and let us know if you experience any discomfort or changes in your condition. We will continue to follow up with you to ensure your recovery goes smoothly.","S: The patient, a post-liver transplant recipient, reports severe abdominal pain and has a history of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, the patient experienced some relief from pain with fentanyl infusion but still describes the pain as quite painful. Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness were noted upon opioid discontinuation.
O: The patient was initially managed with a continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion, starting at 1200 μg/day and increased to 2400 μg/day based on pain intensity. Following the discontinuation of fentanyl, withdrawal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness occurred. These symptoms resolved upon resuming fentanyl at 240 μg/day. A transdermal fentanyl patch was later used to taper the opioid more gradually. The patient's pancreatitis recurred transiently, requiring resumption and gradual tapering of fentanyl infusion from 600 μg/day to 60 μg/day over several days. The patient reports feeling much better following the complete discontinuation of fentanyl, 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.
A: The primary diagnosis is severe acute pancreatitis post-liver transplantation, complicated by opioid withdrawal symptoms following fentanyl discontinuation. The patient's response to the reintroduction and gradual tapering of fentanyl suggests effective management of withdrawal symptoms.
P: Continue monitoring the patient's symptoms and recovery post-pancreatitis and post-fentanyl discontinuation. Follow-up appointments should be scheduled regularly to assess pain levels, pancreatitis status, and any potential recurrence of symptoms. Education on recognizing signs of pancreatitis and opioid withdrawal should be provided.

How have you been feeling recently?\nPatient: Well, lately I developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day). How has your pain been since then?\nPatient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful.\nDoctor: I see. In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?\nPatient: The patch has been helpful; I've noticed a difference.\nDoctor: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 μg/day. We have been gradually decreasing the dose daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day). As your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms. The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms. How are you feeling now?\nPatient: I'm feeling much better now, thank you.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. Make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and let us know if you experience any discomfort or changes in your condition. We will continue to follow up with you to ensure your recovery goes smoothly.""}

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some pain in my right chest lately.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your background? Are you a smoker?
Patient: No, I am a non-smoker. I work as an engineer for a gas company.
Doctor: Alright. Have you had any exposure to asbestos in your workplace?
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Let's perform a physical examination to check for any issues in your lungs. [After examination] I noticed a reduction of lung sounds at the right lung basis, but no clinical sign of autoimmune disease.
Patient: Hmm, what could be causing the chest pain then?
Doctor: We will need to perform a chest X-ray (CXR) to investigate further. [After CXR] The results show a considerable reduction in the right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there is fluid around your right lung. We should perform more tests to determine the cause. [After tests] All serological, autoimmune, and microbiological tests came back negative. Let's do a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a better view. [After CT] The CT scan revealed a slight reduction in right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
Patient: What's the next step?
Doctor: We will conduct a supplemental investigation to rule out any history of trauma, tuberculosis, and pneumothorax. We will also perform an echocardiography to exclude pulmonary hypertension, and a diaphragm dysfunction test through phrenic nerve stimulation. [After investigations] All tests were negative.
Doctor: We'll proceed with a total body positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) to check for any abnormalities. [After PET-CT] There was a low-intensity hyper-accumulation of 18-FDG in the right pleura with increased concentration in the basal, middle, and posterior pleural surface.
Patient: What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We'll perform a surgical lung biopsy (SLB) to identify the issue. [After SLB] The biopsy identified non-specific fibrinous pleurisy, but the search for neoplastic or infectious cells was negative.
Doctor: Unfortunately, your forced vital capacity (FVC) has dropped significantly over the previous 3 years, and you have developed shortness of breath on exertion. I am going to prescribe a prednisolone course to help with the symptoms.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Sadly, your condition has worsened with the onset of restrictive respiratory failure. It's important to keep a close eye on your health and report any changes.

"Doctor: Hello, I heard you have a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of your mouth, and you were referred to our institution. How can I help you today?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I've been experiencing some difficulty in swallowing, but I haven't had any pain or tongue paralysis.
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an intraoral examination to better understand the issue. Hmm, I can see a well-defined 3.5 × 3 × 2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland. It's covered with light bluish smooth mucus. Do you feel any pain when I apply pressure to the tumor?
Patient: Yes, I feel slight pain when you press on it.
Doctor: Alright. Your tongue's mobility and sensory functions seem to be normal, and I don't detect any lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region on palpation. We'll need to conduct some laboratory tests and an enhanced computed tomography scan to get a clearer picture of the issue.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
[After the tests]
Doctor: Your lab results are all normal, and the enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 2.8 × 1.8 × 2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that doesn't appear to involve the mandible. We also found a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions.
Patient: So, what does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: Based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. We will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it.
Patient: Alright, so what will the surgery involve?
Doctor: During the surgery, we'll make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, we'll find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland. We'll carefully free the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve from the tumor surface, and completely excise the tumor along with the sublingual gland.
Patient: I see. What happens after the surgery?
Doctor: After the surgery, we'll fix the tissue sample with 10% formalin and submit it for histopathological diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the tumor.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'm ready to proceed with the surgery and follow-up care.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll make sure to take good care of you during and after the surgery. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.","S: The patient reports a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of the mouth, accompanied by difficulty swallowing.

Patient: Yes, that's true. It's been really hard for me to walk lately.
Doctor: Okay, let's review your vital signs from the day of admission. Your temperature was 97.9 F, heart rate 68 beats/min, blood pressure 137/84 mmHg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. You were alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Now, let's discuss your neurological examination findings. You showed right-sided hemiparesis and significant leg stiffness. Your strength in your right arm was 4/5, and in your right leg, it was 3/5. Your left side was unremarkable.
Patient: Yeah, I've been having difficulty moving my right side.
Doctor: We also found that your cranial nerves 2-10 were normal, but you had difficulty shrugging your right shoulder and couldn't turn your head to the left. When walking, your gait was unsteady, and you compensated with your non-affected side. The rest of your physical examination was within normal limits.
Patient: Okay, what about the tests you did on me?
Doctor: Your laboratory values were within normal limits. We performed a head computed tomography (CT) and a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which were both negative for a stroke. However, your cervical spine CT showed marked degenerative changes, including moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at C4/C5.
Patient: Oh, what does that mean?
Doctor: We performed an MRI of your cervical spine without contrast, which confirmed the moderate to severe central stenosis with cord compression and mildly increased T2 signal at C4/C5 and C5/C6. There were degenerative findings between levels C3-C7, along with hypertrophy.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we'll discuss potential treatment options and closely monitor your condition. It's important to follow up with your primary care physician and a specialist to address the spinal stenosis and any related symptoms.","S: The patient, a male with a history of prostate cancer and prostatectomy, presents with a one-month history of tingling and numbness in his right arm and leg.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I am a 76-year-old woman and my chief complaint is backache.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have hypertension and lumbar spinal canal stenosis.
Doctor: Have you been treated with an oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent for these conditions?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: When did you first notice the backache?
Patient: The discomfort started about 4 days ago without any obvious cause.
Doctor: Has your backache worsened since then?
Patient: Yes, it aggravated suddenly, and I also had vomiting and difficulty with body movement.
Doctor: Did you seek medical help for these symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I visited the Department of Surgery at your hospital and was admitted for examination and treatment.
Doctor: Were there any abnormal findings on thoracoabdominal CT or endoscopy from a surgical perspective?
Patient: They didn't find anything abnormal, so they referred me to your department.
Doctor: Alright, let's discuss your initial examination. Your body temperature was 36.2°C, blood pressure was 192/109 mmHg, and pulse was 79/min. You had a mild disturbance of orientation with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of E4, V4, M6. Have you experienced a severe headache along with the backache?
Patient: No, just the severe backache.
Doctor: Okay. During your neurological examination, we didn't find any hypesthesia or muscle weakness of the lower limbs. Your deep tendon reflexes were normal, and there were no abnormalities in hemorrhage and coagulation test findings. On plain radiography at admission, there were also no abnormal findings in the thoracolumbar vertebrae. We performed a lumbar spinal MRI 4 days after the onset, which showed a band-like shadow continuous from the thoracic spinal level, with high intensity on T1-weighted imaging and low intensity on T2-weighted imaging, and STIR. To examine the lesion at the upper level more closely, we performed a thoracic spinal MRI 7 days after the onset. It revealed a band-like shadow extending from Th2 to L3 on the subdural extramedullary ventral side. A mass was present in the shadow at Th7, compressing and deforming the spinal cord centered on this region, with changes in intramedullary brightness of Th6.
Patient: That sounds concerning. What does it mean?

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I'm a 36-year-old gravida 2, para 1 Caucasian woman, and I'm currently 9 weeks pregnant. I've been having headaches lately.
Doctor: I see. Are you experiencing any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms?
Patient: No, just the headaches.
Doctor: Alright. I understand that your previous in vitro fertilization pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia at 27 weeks of gestation, and you delivered a growth-restricted fetus by cesarean section at 36 weeks, weighing 1900 g. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: It seems that your regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Additionally, your family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, you've got it right.
Doctor: During your pregnancy, laboratory investigations for preeclampsia revealed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, as well as normal renal and liver function. Your vasculitic screen showed a normal C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Does that sound correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what the tests showed.
Doctor: At 34 weeks, your ultrasound indicated that the estimated fetal weight was in the 94th percentile, and your placental vascular resistance was normal. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. The differential diagnoses for your major finding of significant infrarenal aortic stenosis include congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. In your case, the presence of a well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy.
Patient: Okay, so what does that mean?
Doctor: Since you don't have any clinical history or signs of neurofibromatosis, tuberculosis, or radiation exposure, and there is little evidence of active inflammation, the diagnosis could be chronic abdominal aortopathy from congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis. We will need to continue monitoring your condition and possibly adjust your treatment plan accordingly.
Patient: I understand. What should I do next?
Doctor: We will keep a close eye on your pregnancy and monitor your headaches as well as any potential symptoms related to your aortic stenosis. It is important to continue taking your medications and attending regular check-ups. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or have any concerns, please reach out to us immediately.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if you need any assistance.","S: The patient is a 36-year-old gravida 2, para 1 Caucasian woman, currently 9 weeks pregnant, presenting with headaches.

I've been having headaches lately.\nDoctor: I see. Are you experiencing any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms?\nPatient: No, just the headaches.\nDoctor: Alright. I understand that your previous in vitro fertilization pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia at 27 weeks of gestation, and you delivered a growth-restricted fetus by cesarean section at 36 weeks, weighing 1900 g. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: It seems that your regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Additionally, your family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, you've got it right.\nDoctor: During your pregnancy, laboratory investigations for preeclampsia revealed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, as well as normal renal and liver function. Your vasculitic screen showed a normal C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Does that sound correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what the tests showed.\nDoctor: At 34 weeks, your ultrasound indicated that the estimated fetal weight was in the 94th percentile, and your placental vascular resistance was normal. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. The differential diagnoses for your major finding of significant infrarenal aortic stenosis include congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. In your case, the presence of a well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy.\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\nDoctor: Since you don't have any clinical history or signs of neurofibromatosis, tuberculosis, or radiation exposure, and there is little evidence of active inflammation, the diagnosis could be chronic abdominal aortopathy from congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis. We will need to continue monitoring your condition and possibly adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\nPatient: I understand. What should I do next?\nDoctor: We will keep a close eye on your pregnancy and monitor your headaches as well as any potential symptoms related to your aortic stenosis. It is important to continue taking your medications and attending regular check-ups. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or have any concerns, please reach out to us immediately.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having difficulty walking recently.
Doctor: I see. How long has this been going on?
Patient: It started about three days ago. I felt some discomfort in the front of my knee and it turned into pain the next day.
Doctor: Was there any injury or specific event that could have caused this?
Patient: No, there was no injury or anything that I can think of.
Doctor: Alright. Have you noticed any swelling of the joint?
Patient: No, there's no swelling.
Doctor: Okay. Let me examine your knee. I'll check for tenderness at the medial and lateral femorotibial joint, and other tests like the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, varus/valgus instability, and McMurray test, okay?
Patient: Sure, go ahead.
Doctor: *Performs tests* All those tests were negative, which is a good sign. However, I noticed that your range of motion is severely restricted due to the pain. Did you receive any treatment so far?
Patient: Yes, I was given an intra-articular injection of xylocaine, and it helped temporarily, but then I started feeling a catching sensation in my knee when I moved it.
Doctor: Okay, let's take a look at some imaging tests. *Examines radiographs and MRI* The simple radiographs showed no abnormal findings, but the MRI revealed a soft tissue mass located near your knee joint. It has an ill-defined border and high signal intensities on both T1- and T2-weighted images. On fat-suppressed images, it has low signal intensity, and there's no contrast enhancement in contrast imaging. Your blood examination also showed no abnormal findings.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What do you suggest I do?
Doctor: Considering your persistent symptoms, I recommend surgery to remove the mass. We can perform a knee arthroscopy to get a better look at it and remove it if necessary.
Patient: Okay, I'd like to go ahead with the surgery.
Doctor: *Performs surgery* During the surgery, we found a large fat mass with mobility on the anterior surface of the proximal-lateral PF joint. It looked like fat and had an ill-defined border. We removed it piece by piece through a resection. Histologically, it was mainly composed of connective tissue and fatty tissue, but we didn't find any signs of lipoma, lipoma arborescens, or pigmented villonodular synovitis.
Patient: That's a relief. How are my symptoms now?
Doctor: Your symptoms have improved since the surgery, and there are no more signs of anterior knee pain or any other issues.
Patient: That's great. Thank you so much, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Be sure to follow up with us if you have any concerns or if your symptoms return. Take care!","S: The patient, a 34-year-old male, presented with a chief complaint of difficulty walking that started three days ago. He described initial discomfort in the front of his knee, which progressed to pain the following day. The patient denied any preceding injury or specific event that could have triggered the symptoms. He also reported a temporary relief from pain after receiving an intra-articular injection of xylocaine, but noted a subsequent catching sensation in the knee.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you have a history of cholelithiasis. Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.
Doctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.
Patient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?
Doctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.
Patient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?
Doctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.
Patient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?
Doctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.
Patient: So, what was done during the surgery?
Doctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.
Patient: How was the ARHD removed?
Doctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?
Doctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.","S: The patient reports experiencing bothersome pain in the right upper abdomen.

Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.\nDoctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\nPatient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\nDoctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.\nPatient: So, what was done during the surgery?\nDoctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\nPatient: How was the ARHD removed?\nDoctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?\nDoctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing. Make sure to follow any post-operative instructions and contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I received your medical records. You're a 50-year-old African American female, and you presented with a three-week history of intractable headache, confusion, vertical binocular diplopia, photophobia, and difficulty with balance, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. These symptoms have been bothering me for a while now.
Doctor: I see. During the examination, your best corrected visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Your intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg in both eyes, and no afferent pupillary defect was noted. Your extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full in both eyes. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: The anterior segment examination in both eyes was unremarkable. However, the funduscopic examination revealed grade-four optic disc edema, blurring of the optic disc margin, and obscuration of vasculature of the optic nerve. Preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages were present in both eyes, mainly in the peripapillary retina but also extending to the mid-peripheral retina. Are you following so far?
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: Optic nerve swelling was confirmed on optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Fluorescein angiography revealed hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in both eyes. 
Patient: Okay, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: We also performed computed tomography of the head, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and magnetic resonance venography of the brain. These tests were unremarkable and showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or ischemia.
Patient: That's good news, right?
Doctor: Yes, it's good that we didn't find any of those issues. Moving on to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, it revealed an opening pressure of 30 cm H2O, 77 white blood cells/mm3 with 94% lymphocytes, 93 mg/dL protein, and 73 mg/dL glucose.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Bacterial and fungal cultures of the CSF were negative, as were CSF studies for Lyme, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, and West Nile virus. A limited panel of laboratory studies for enterovirus, syphilis, ANA, and p-ANCA was also negative. Lastly, a respiratory viral panel for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative.
Patient: So, what's causing my symptoms?
Doctor: At this point, we've ruled out many possible causes, but we still need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's important for you to have follow-up appointments and additional tests as necessary so we can identify the cause and develop a treatment plan for you.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I'll make sure to schedule those follow-up appointments.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you are a 53-year-old woman with a posterior, stage IIB NSCLC in the left upper lobe. You've received neoadjuvant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and radiotherapy already. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any discomfort or new symptoms recently?
Patient: Yeah, doctor. I've been having severe left back pain and left axillary numbness and paresthesia.
Doctor: I see. Based on your symptoms, we conducted some tests and found that the tumor has attached to the T2 and T3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots. This is likely the cause of your complaints. We consulted the neurosurgery and thoracic surgery services to discuss the best management for your condition.
Patient: What did they recommend, doctor?
Doctor: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed that there was no direct tumor invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. After discussing different treatment options, they recommended a posterior approach, image-guided T2 and T3 osteotomy followed by transthoracic en bloc resection of the thoracic tumor.
Patient: Will that help with the pain and numbness?
Doctor: Yes, the operation aims to address the issues caused by the tumor attachment and infiltration. You'll need to give your informed consent for the procedure.
Patient: Alright, I agree to the operation.
Doctor: Great. During the operation, we'll make an initial incision in the operating room and expose the spinal processes, lamina, and transverse processes from T1 through T5 as well as 5 cm of the ribs from the left costovertebral junction on the side of the tumor. We'll then take images with the O-Arm and register your spine to the StealthStation navigation suite using a stereotactic probe.
Patient: What happens next?
Doctor: We'll use spine navigation to place the instrumentation at the level above and below the tumor-infiltrated vertebrae. We won't place screws on the left T2 and T3 vertebrae. The spinous processes and lamina of T2 and T3 will be removed, and the nerve roots will be exposed on the left side.
Patient: And then you'll remove the tumor?
Doctor: Yes, during the resection, we'll notice an infiltration of the ganglia by the primary tumor that is in continuity with the ribs on the left side. We'll proceed with resection, tying the T2 and T3 nerve roots.
Patient: Okay, doctor. I hope this will help with my pain and numbness.
Doctor: We believe it will help to alleviate your symptoms. We'll provide you with follow-up care instructions after the operation to ensure a smooth recovery.","S: The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of stage IIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the left upper lobe, previously treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and radiotherapy.

O: Examination and imaging revealed that the NSCLC has attached to the T2 and T3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots, without direct invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. MRI studies were utilized to assess the extent of tumor involvement.
A: The primary diagnosis is stage IIB NSCLC with vertebral and nerve root involvement by the tumor. The symptoms of pain and paresthesia are attributed to this involvement.

You've received neoadjuvant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and radiotherapy already. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any discomfort or new symptoms recently?\nPatient: Yeah, doctor. I've been having severe left back pain and left axillary numbness and paresthesia.\nDoctor: I see. Based on your symptoms, we conducted some tests and found that the tumor has attached to the T2 and T3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots. This is likely the cause of your complaints. We consulted the neurosurgery and thoracic surgery services to discuss the best management for your condition.\nPatient: What did they recommend, doctor?\nDoctor: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed that there was no direct tumor invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. After discussing different treatment options, they recommended a posterior approach, image-guided T2 and T3 osteotomy followed by transthoracic en bloc resection of the thoracic tumor.\nPatient: Will that help with the pain and numbness?\nDoctor: Yes, the operation aims to address the issues caused by the tumor attachment and infiltration. You'll need to give your informed consent for the procedure.\nPatient: Alright, I agree to the operation.\nDoctor: Great. During the operation, we'll make an initial incision in the operating room and expose the spinal processes, lamina, and transverse processes from T1 through T5 as well as 5 cm of the ribs from the left costovertebral junction on the side of the tumor. We'll then take images with the O-Arm and register your spine to the StealthStation navigation suite using a stereotactic probe.\nPatient: What happens next?\nDoctor: We'll use spine navigation to place the instrumentation at the level above and below the tumor-infiltrated vertebrae. We won't place screws on the left T2 and T3 vertebrae. The spinous processes and lamina of T2 and T3 will be removed, and the nerve roots will be exposed on the left side.\nPatient: And then you'll remove the tumor?\nDoctor: Yes, during the resection, we'll notice an infiltration of the ganglia by the primary tumor that is in continuity with the ribs on the left side. We'll proceed with resection, tying the T2 and T3 nerve roots.\nPatient: Okay, doctor. I hope this will help with my pain and numbness.\nDoctor: We believe it will help to alleviate your symptoms. We'll provide you with follow-up care instructions after the operation to ensure a smooth recovery.""}

"Doctor: Good morning! How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I am a 70-year-old woman and I was admitted to the cardiovascular department for chest distress for 11 hours. I have been experiencing shortness of breath at rest and difficulty laying in the recumbent position.
Doctor: I see. Have you had any prior medical conditions?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus a few years ago and have been taking oral medication for their treatment.
Doctor: Okay, let me explain what happened after your initial admission. After your clinical examination, you were diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. You underwent coronary angiography and stent implantation, and during the operation, heparin was administered, which included an arterial intrathecal injection of 2000 units and an intravenous injection of 3500 units.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: After the angiography, we prescribed you aspirin (100 mg per day), TiGraylo (90 mg once every 12 h), and enoxaparin sodium (0.4 mL once every 12 h subcutaneously) for 3 days. Your chest distress and shortness of breath had relieved. However, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: During the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. There was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. We conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin (102 g/L), prolonged prothrombin time (13.4 s), and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: These results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. Moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. An abdominal CT scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced CT scan. The left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.
Patient: So, what's the treatment for this?
Doctor: We tried conservative treatment, which included stopping your anticoagulant medications, providing total parenteral nutrition, and monitoring your condition. However, your clinical symptoms did not resolve with this approach. We will continue to evaluate your condition and discuss further treatment options with you.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor, for explaining all this to me. I hope we can find a solution soon.","S: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who presented with chest distress lasting 11 hours, shortness of breath at rest, and difficulty lying in the recumbent position. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, for which she takes oral medications. She reports relief of initial symptoms post coronary angiography and stent implantation but developed hematochezia on the third day post-operation without abdominal pain.
O: Initial examination post-admission led to a diagnosis of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. Treatment included coronary angiography, stent implantation, and administration of heparin (2000 units arterial intrathecal and 3500 units intravenous). Post-procedure medications were aspirin 100 mg/day, TiGraylo 90 mg every 12 hours, and enoxaparin sodium 0.4 mL every 12 hours subcutaneously for 3 days. On the third day post-operation, the patient developed hematochezia. Examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant, peritoneal irritation signs, and a neoplasm-like mucous clot in the anus. Lab tests showed hemoglobin at 102 g/L (normal: 120-160 g/L), prothrombin time 13.4 s (normal: 11-13.5 s), and INR 1.2. Colonoscopy identified a submucosal mass in the sigmoid colon with a partially ruptured mucous membrane. Abdominal CT scan confirmed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon and thickening at the left flexure of the colon.
A: The primary diagnosis is coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, complicated by post-operative hematochezia likely due to anticoagulation therapy. Differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal neoplasm versus hematoma secondary to anticoagulation. The prognosis depends on the management of the gastrointestinal complications and the underlying heart disease.
P: The initial management included discontinuation of anticoagulants, administration of total parenteral nutrition, and close monitoring. Given the lack of resolution of clinical symptoms with conservative treatment, further evaluation and possible intervention for the sigmoid colon issue are planned. Continued cardiovascular management with adjustments to anticoagulation therapy will be necessary, considering the gastrointestinal risks.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you are a 64-year-old postmenopausal woman who was referred to our hospital after your first screening colonoscopy revealed an adenocarcinoma. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Based on the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the colonic lesion, it was positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and ER, weakly positive for MOC-31, and negative for CK-20, CD-X2, PR, PAX-8, SOX-10, CD45, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and TTF-1. These findings are consistent with a breast primary. Were you experiencing any symptoms or palpable masses before the colonoscopy?
Patient: No, I was asymptomatic and didn't feel any masses or lymphadenopathy.
Doctor: I see. You mentioned having a surgical history of hysterectomy secondary to symptomatic fibroids. Is your family history negative for cancers?
Patient: Yes, no one in my family has had cancer.
Doctor: Okay. I noticed that you had a screening mammography a month prior, which came back normal. However, a computerized tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in August 2015 showed osteolytic thoracic vertebral and pelvic lesions, as well as bilateral axillary adenopathy measuring up to 1.4 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) CT in October 2015 revealed metabolic activity in the right axilla and patchy radiotracer uptake involving the vertebral column corresponding to the CT findings. Are you following me so far?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: In November 2015, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the right axillary lymph node was performed but came back negative for malignancy. Your CEA, CA 19-9, and CA-125 levels were all within normal limits (2.08 ng/mL, <1 U/mL, and 6.4 U/mL, respectively). Were you aware of these test results?
Patient: Yes, I knew about those results.
Doctor: You started seeing an oncologist in March 2016 and were given anastrozole until further workup was done. A repeat mammography and breast ultrasound showed only bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. A bone biopsy of a right sacral lesion confirmed metastatic breast invasive ductal carcinoma with IHC positive for CK-7, GATA-3, ER, and PR but negative for CD45.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having pain and swelling in my right submandibular region for about 10 days now.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any particular patterns to the pain and swelling?
Patient: Yeah, the swelling and pain seems to be intermittent during meals, but it resolves after I finish eating. I also have unpleasant sensations when eating sour or acidic food.
Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Let's proceed with a clinical examination. 
[Doctor examines patient]
Doctor: I can see the swelling on your right submandibular region, extraorally. There doesn't appear to be any discharge associated with the swelling. I'm going to perform a bimanual palpation now.
[Doctor performs bimanual palpation]
Doctor: I can feel a firm swelling in the posterior floor of your mouth. Based on my assessment, I believe you have right submandibular salivary gland sialolithiasis. We'll need a computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm this diagnosis.
Patient: Okay, so what happens if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis?
Doctor: If the diagnosis is confirmed, we'll need to surgically remove the gland. The surgery will involve making a Risdon incision about 3 to 4 cm below your mandible. We'll identify and protect your marginal mandibular nerve and remove the submandibular gland from the mylohyoid muscle. Then, we'll divide and ligate the submandibular duct to remove the gland along with the calculi. In your case, we found a 7 mm spherical formation.
Patient: Will there be any postoperative complications?
Doctor: We'll place a suction drain and close the wound in layers to minimize the risk of complications. It's essential to attend your follow-up evaluations to monitor your recovery and ensure there are no postoperative complications.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've come in today for an evaluation of worsening dyspnea, cough, and hypoxemia. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having more trouble breathing lately, and I've developed a cough. I also feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen.
Doctor: I understand. Based on your medical history, you have limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Do you have any history of atopy or food allergies?
Patient: No, I don't. I do use an albuterol inhaler as needed though.
Doctor: That's helpful to know. Your PAH was diagnosed seven years ago, with a reported pulmonary artery pressure of 80/39 mmHg, mean PA pressure of 56 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mmHg, and cardiac output by thermodilution of 3.17 L/min. Your pulmonary function tests at that time showed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.06 L (75% predicted) and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 19.61 mL/min/mm Hg (66% predicted). You were treated with dual therapy, tadalafil and macitentan, for PAH and were able to wean from oxygen supplementation. How has this treatment been working for you?
Patient: It worked well for a while, but recently I've been feeling worse.
Doctor: I see. Your ILD was considered mild, and you didn't require supplemental oxygen at rest or with exertion. You were treated with mycophenolate mofetil for a year after your initial diagnosis. However, you discontinued this medication about 6 years ago due to fear of reactivating remote Lyme infection after reading about chronic Lyme disease on the internet. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Your medical records indicate that you had been stable on your regimen of tadalafil and macitentan until 3 months ago when you began to experience rapidly progressive dyspnea and new onset hypoxemia. A recent right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed that your PAH had worsened, with a mean PA pressure of 72 mmHg and a new drop in cardiac index (1.7 L/min/m2). As a result, you were started on subcutaneous treprostinil. How have you been feeling since starting this new medication?
Patient: I'm still not feeling great. My breathing has been getting worse, and the cough hasn't gone away.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to closely monitor your symptoms and possibly adjust your medications. It's important to keep up with your regular appointments and let us know if there are any changes in your condition. In the meantime, continue using your albuterol inhaler as needed.
Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to keep you updated and come in for regular check-ups.

How has this treatment been working for you?\nPatient: It worked well for a while, but recently I've been feeling worse.\nDoctor: I see. Your ILD was considered mild, and you didn't require supplemental oxygen at rest or with exertion. You were treated with mycophenolate mofetil for a year after your initial diagnosis. However, you discontinued this medication about 6 years ago due to fear of reactivating remote Lyme infection after reading about chronic Lyme disease on the internet. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Your medical records indicate that you had been stable on your regimen of tadalafil and macitentan until 3 months ago when you began to experience rapidly progressive dyspnea and new onset hypoxemia. A recent right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed that your PAH had worsened, with a mean PA pressure of 72 mmHg and a new drop in cardiac index (1.7 L/min/m2). As a result, you were started on subcutaneous treprostinil. How have you been feeling since starting this new medication?\nPatient: I'm still not feeling great. My breathing has been getting worse, and the cough hasn't gone away.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to closely monitor your symptoms and possibly adjust your medications. It's important to keep up with your regular appointments and let us know if there are any changes in your condition. In the meantime, continue using your albuterol inhaler as needed.\nPatient: Okay, I'll make sure to keep you updated and come in for regular check-ups.\nDoctor: Thank you. I hope we can find a treatment plan that works well for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

"Doctor: Good morning! What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling sick for the past four days. I've had a fever, muscle pain, and vomiting. I've also noticed I've been drinking a lot of water, peeing a lot, waking up at night to pee, and losing weight for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any prior underlying diseases? 
Patient: No, I don't have any underlying diseases.
Doctor: What about your family history? Is there any history of diabetes mellitus in your family?
Patient: No, there's no family history of diabetes.
Doctor: Okay, and do you use tobacco, alcohol, or any illicit drugs?
Patient: No, I don't use any of those.
Doctor: Alright. Let's check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 115/78 mm Hg, your temperature is 36.6°C, and your pulse rate is 96 beats per min. You appear to be mildly dehydrated.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: We've also performed some tests. Your venous plasma glucose was recorded at 467 mg/dL, and there are wide anion gap metabolic acidosis and high levels of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate present. Based on these findings, you have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Don't worry; we'll start treating you right away. We've already given you 1 liter of isotonic saline over one hour, and we'll continue to administer it at 500 mL/hr. We'll also replete your potassium levels and give you a bolus of insulin, followed by continuous insulin infusion. We've also done an electrocardiogram that showed sinus tachycardia, and a chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Additionally, we've found that you have a dengue infection based on your laboratory results. A systemic review revealed that you currently have vaginal bleeding. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is evidenced by hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic manifestation in your case.
Patient: Oh no, that's concerning.
Doctor: After six hours of treatment, you mentioned you had chest discomfort and developed puffy eyelids and mild pitting edema in both legs. Upon lung examination, we heard fine crepitation in both lungs. A chest x-ray revealed bilateral hilar congestion. These abnormalities occurred after the administration of 3 L of isotonic saline.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: We detected leakage syndrome, so we've decreased the rate of intravenous fluid from 140 to 60 mL/hr. We'll closely monitor your urine output every hour and manage your fluid balance to be negative. This will help improve your condition.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. With these adjustments, your clinical status should gradually improve. We'll continue to monitor your progress and make any necessary changes in your treatment. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to ask.

"Doctor: Hi there! I see you've presented with hoarseness and dysphagia for the past three months following an upper respiratory infection. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, my voice has been really hoarse, and I've had trouble swallowing too.
Doctor: I understand. I also noticed in your past medical history that you had invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which was ER positive, PR negative, and HER2 negative. You were treated with a mastectomy two years prior to this presentation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: During the clinical examination, we found paralysis of your right vocal cord. We also performed a CT scan of your neck, which revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
Patient: No, not really. Just the hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.
Doctor: Okay. We performed a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule, which was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance, falling under Bethesda category III. We did a repeat FNA three months later, and it yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule, which is Bethesda category II. 
Patient: I see.
Doctor: Due to your persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, as well as the atypical findings on the initial FNA, we decided to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy and a right vocal cord injection. Intraoperatively, we observed that your right thyroid lobe was moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: The right lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm in greatest dimension and weighed 16 grams. Upon further examination, we found multiple variably sized brown gelatinous nodules with focal areas of hemorrhage and cystic change in the thyroid parenchyma.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: The histologic examination revealed evidence of nodular thyroid hyperplasia. We also found multiple scattered subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma, which were present in 7 out of the 16 submitted tissue sections. Most of these smaller metastatic foci measured around 1 millimeter each and consisted of irregularly shaped nests of epithelioid tumor cells between thyroid follicles.
Patient: Oh, no.
Doctor: The largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma with cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact. These areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Additionally, we observed numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of C cell hyperplasia (CCH).
Patient: What should I do now?
Doctor: We'll need to discuss your treatment options and closely monitor your condition. We'll work together to determine the best course of action moving forward. It's important to stay vigilant and report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare team.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll make sure to keep in touch with my healthcare team.","S: The patient reports persistent hoarseness and dysphagia for three months following an upper respiratory infection. The patient has a history of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, treated with mastectomy two years ago. No new symptoms were reported besides the existing hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.
O: Clinical examination revealed right vocal cord paralysis. CT scan showed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral nodules. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda category III) and later as a benign follicular nodule (Bethesda category II). Right thyroid lobectomy and right vocal cord injection were performed; the lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm and weighed 16 grams. Histologic examination indicated nodular thyroid hyperplasia and multiple subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma in 7 out of 16 tissue sections, with the largest metastatic focus measuring 0.6 cm.
A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic breast carcinoma to the thyroid, presenting with nodular thyroid hyperplasia and right vocal cord paralysis. Differential diagnosis initially included benign thyroid nodules and potential primary thyroid malignancies, which were ruled out by histopathological examination. The presence of metastatic breast carcinoma in the thyroid is a significant finding, indicating systemic spread.
P: The management plan includes close monitoring of the patient's condition with regular follow-ups to assess for any progression of metastatic disease or emergence of new symptoms. The patient will be referred to oncology for further evaluation and management of metastatic breast carcinoma. Symptomatic treatment for hoarseness and dysphagia, including possible speech therapy, will be considered.

"Doctor: Hello, I wanted to discuss your current situation and review your surgical history with you. Can you tell me what brought you to our facility initially?
Patient: Yes, I came in with a strangulated large bowel and ventral hernia, 10 years after my LAGB procedure.
Doctor: That's correct. At that time, you were still morbidly obese and had been lost to follow-up. We performed an emergency surgical hernia repair, which included resection of the necrotic transverse colon, and created a loop ileostomy. One year later, you presented with a LAGB port-site infection. Do you remember what we did during that time?
Patient: Yes, you removed the port and sutured the tubing to my abdominal wall.
Doctor: Exactly. During both admissions, we observed the LAGB tubing in a stable position adjacent to the transverse colon on the CT scans, with no concerns for penetration. Six months after the port-site infection, we elected to reverse the ileostomy. However, there were complications in the early post-operative period. Can you tell me about those symptoms?
Patient: I remember feeling really sick and ended up having abdominal sepsis.
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. The abdominal CT demonstrated transection of the remaining proximal transverse colon by the LAGB tubing. Due to this, we had to perform a right hemicolectomy, which involved the removal of the gastric band and tubing, and we created an end ileostomy. 
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's the plan moving forward, doctor?
Doctor: Our main focus now is to ensure proper healing and monitor for any complications. We'll keep a close eye on your progress and address any issues that may arise.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the care you've provided, and I'll make sure to follow your instructions and communicate any concerns.

Slit lamp biomicroscopy showed no anterior segment pathology; intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a yellowish macular lesion with surrounding RPE changes and angioid streaks, sparing the macula. SD-OCT showed a subfoveal hyperreflective deposit and mild stippling in the macular area. Fluoroscein angiography indicated staining of the macular lesion in late phases. Ferritin levels are within normal limits.\nA: The primary assessment is a suspected DFO retinopathy given the patient's history of chelation therapy and ocular findings. Differential diagnosis could include other causes of macular degeneration, but the specific history and imaging findings point towards DFO retinopathy.\nP: Plan to perform a full-field electroretinogram to assess retinal function and confirm DFO retinopathy. Based on the results, treatment options and follow-up care will be discussed. The patient is advised to schedule a follow-up appointment after the electrophysiology testing to review results and plan further management. Continuation of current systemic treatments for beta thalassemia intermedia and hypothyroidism should be maintained.""}]",[],"S: The patient reports experiencing metamophopsia and reduced visual acuity in both of their eyes, which has been gradually worsening over the past four months. The patient has a history of beta thalassemia intermedia and has been receiving blood transfusions and chelation therapy for 14 years. The patient also has hypothyroidism and is treated with levothyroxine.
O: The patient's best corrected visual acuity is 20/25 in the right eye and 20/22 in the left eye. Slit lamp biomicroscopy did not reveal any pathology in the anterior segment, and intraocular pressure measured by applanation tonometry is 14 mmHg in both eyes. Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography showed a subfoveal hyperreflective deposit above the level of the RPE, with mild stippling in the macular area in fundus autofluorescence. Fluoroscein angiography revealed staining of the macular lesion in the late phases of the angiogram.
A: The primary diagnosis is DFO retinopathy in the right eye. The presence of subfoveal hyperreflective deposit and mild stippling in the macular area suggest DFO retinopathy. The patient's history of beta thalassemia and chelation therapy may have contributed to the development of DFO retinopathy.
P: The patient will undergo full-field electroretinogram to assess retinal function and determine the presence of DFO retinopathy. Follow-up will include a full-field electroretinogram to assess retinal function and determine the appropriate course of treatment. The patient will be advised to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the electroretinogram and the management of DFO retinopathy. "
"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doc. I've been having this typical chest pain for a week now, and it worsened about 3 hours before I came here. I also have dyspnea, nausea, and sweating.
Doctor: I see. Let me check your vitals first. Your blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg, heart rate is 54 beats/minute, respiratory rate is 22 times/minute, and temperature is 37 °C. All of these are within normal limits. Let's also do a neurological examination. 
Patient: Sure, doc.
Doctor: Your neurological examination is unremarkable. Do you have any history of medical conditions?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of dyslipidemia and hypertension. But no diabetes. My father also had hypertension.
Doctor: Alright. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
Patient: I quit smoking 17 months ago, and I don't drink alcohol.
Doctor: Good to hear. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm on captopril, bisoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and atorvastatin.
Doctor: Have you been compliant with your warfarin regimen?
Patient: To be honest, I haven't been very compliant, especially a few weeks after hospital discharge and at 7 and 13 months before this admission.
Doctor: I understand. We did an Electrocardiography and it showed sinus rhythm of 54 beats/minute, left ventricular hypertrophy, horizontal ST-segment depression, and T wave inversion at leads I, aVL, and V4–6. A biphasic T wave was observed at lead V2–3. 
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: It indicates some abnormalities in your heart's electrical activity. We also checked your laboratory results. Your international normalized ratio (INR) is suboptimal at 1.28. The level of triglycerides is 273 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are within normal limits. The complete blood count and levels of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase–myocardial band (CK-MB), and high-sensitivity troponin (hs-troponin) T are all normal.
Patient: So, what's the plan, doc?
Doctor: We've given you a loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel along with fondaparinux to alleviate your symptoms. We also performed a Coronary Angiography (CAG) which showed an ectatic and turbulent mid-distal right coronary artery (RCA) and slow flow.
Patient: What should I do now?
Doctor: It's important to continue your medications and be more compliant with your warfarin regimen. We'll closely monitor your condition and consider further treatment options if necessary. Make sure to attend your follow-up appointments.
Patient: Alright, doc. I'll make sure to follow your instructions. Thank you.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and don't hesitate to contact us if your symptoms worsen or you have any concerns.","S: The patient, a known case of dyslipidemia and hypertension, reports experiencing typical chest pain for a week, which worsened approximately 3 hours prior to consultation.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you originally had a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band 4 years ago. What brings you to the bariatric surgery clinic today?
Patient: Yeah, that's right. Lately, I've had trouble tolerating solid foods.
Doctor: I see. We did a work-up and found that your gastric band is still in good position, but you have oesophagitis and gastritis, causing swelling of the mucosa at the band site. We removed the fluid from the reservoir and treated you conservatively with anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. How have your symptoms been after 2 weeks of treatment?
Patient: They've improved a lot, thanks!
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. After careful consideration, you decided to undergo revisional surgery to convert the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy. You went through the appropriate multidisciplinary team and were found to be a suitable candidate for surgery. The surgery went well, and there were no complications. You were discharged on post-operative day 3. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've been okay, but on post-operative day 12, I started feeling lightheaded and short of breath, so I went to the hospital.
Doctor: Yes, you were readmitted to an outside tertiary care hospital and found to have leukocytosis, with a high white blood cell count of 18,000 cells μl–1. A CT scan with intravenous contrast was performed, and you were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. You were immediately transferred to our center for definitive care.
Patient: That's right, and when I arrived here, you all reviewed my CT films.
Doctor: Yes, our radiologists noticed there was air and a faint suggestion of oral contrast outside of the suture line. Given this finding, we ordered an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) evaluation. During the early phase, no leak was observed, partly due to the slow passage of 30 ml oral non-ionic contrast.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Some residual contrast from the outside hospital CT was present in the transverse and descending colon. Only after delayed imaging and administration of additional non-ionic contrast were we able to determine the situation more accurately.
Patient: So, what's the next step, then?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide appropriate treatment. Be sure to follow up with us regularly and report any new or worsening symptoms.

"Doctor: Congratulations on your newborn baby girl! She was delivered via vaginal delivery at 40 weeks and 5 days gestational age, right?
Mother: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I understand that you, the 29-year-old mother, had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Is that correct?
Mother: Yes, everything went smoothly.
Doctor: Good to hear. The physical exam at birth was unremarkable, and all her growth parameters were proportionate and appropriate for her gestational age.
Mother: That's a relief. Thank you.
Doctor: We enrolled your baby in the well-baby cohort of the BabySeq Project. She was randomized to undergo whole-exome sequencing with analysis limited to genes strongly associated with pediatric-onset disorders.
Mother: Oh, okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means we conducted a genetic test to check for any potential health issues that could arise during her childhood. The good news is that there were no major health concerns, surgeries, or hospitalizations between her well-baby nursery discharge and the time genomic results were reported at 2.5 months of age.
Mother: That's great to hear.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I'm a 48-year-old woman and I've noticed a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of my left ring finger. I have a history of enchondroma in the same location.
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an ultrasound examination to get a better understanding of the mass.
(Doctor conducts the ultrasound examination)
Doctor: The ultrasound examination revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass that is connected to the medullary cavity through the interrupted bone cortex. There are no obvious blood signals or calcification in this area. Unfortunately, it's difficult to characterize or classify the mass using traditional ultrasound methods.
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what does that mean for me, doctor?
Doctor: Based on the ultrasound findings, we can confirm that there is a mass located close to the bone. However, due to the limitations of the ultrasound, we cannot precisely determine the nature of the mass. We have included these findings in our ultrasound diagnostic report.
Patient: Hmm, so what's the next step?
Doctor: The next step would be a more detailed examination, such as an MRI or a biopsy, to better understand the nature of the mass and determine the appropriate treatment options.
Patient: Okay, when can we schedule that?
Doctor: I'll have my assistant schedule the MRI or biopsy for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, please monitor any changes in the mass or if you experience any discomfort or pain.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll be in touch with you to schedule the further examination.

A: The primary assessment is a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger, with a differential diagnosis including recurrence of enchondroma or other benign bone tumors. The absence of blood signals and calcifications on ultrasound reduces the likelihood of a malignant process, but further diagnostic workup is necessary to rule out other possibilities.

"Doctor: Hello PT, how can I help you today?
PT: Hey doc, I've been having some issues with memory lately. I've been experiencing recurrent amnesia when I wake up, with disorientation and repetitive questioning, which only lasts for a few minutes.
Doctor: I see, any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PT: Yeah, I've also had these 30-second trance-like episodes during the day. My partner reported that sometimes I make repetitive swallowing movements, followed by disorientation and repetitive questioning. These episodes occur in clusters of up to seven per day.
Doctor: Are you aware of these episodes when they happen?
PT: Well, I'm aware of some of them, but not all. I do have partial recollection of being unable to remember things during those times.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other changes in your memory?
PT: Yes, I've noticed that I lose newly acquired memories over days, and I have difficulty recalling autobiographical events from my adulthood and familiar routes.
Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms along with these memory issues?
PT: I've developed olfactory hallucinations that smell like candy floss, which can last for up to a day and seem to happen independently of the amnestic episodes. I also feel like my sense of smell has become a bit blunted. Plus, I've been having headaches with migrainous features, postural arm tremor, tingling in my legs, malaise, and low mood.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Can you tell me about your medical history?
PT: My medical history is mostly unremarkable, but I did have symptoms of depression last year and a history of heavy alcohol use in the past.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, we conducted several tests and investigations. Your initial brain MRI showed subtly increased T2 signal in the right hippocampus, even in the absence of any recent episodes. Your EEG was normal, and the clinical examination revealed no focal neurological signs. We made an initial clinical diagnosis of TEA.
Doctor: We started treating you with lamotrigine, starting at 25 mg and gradually increasing it up to 100 mg twice a day. This resolved your trance-like and amnestic attacks. However, your other symptoms, such as headaches, tingling sensation in your limbs, and olfactory hallucinations, still persist.
PT: Oh, okay. So what's the next step in my treatment plan?
Doctor: Since the lamotrigine has resolved your amnestic attacks, we will continue monitoring your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. We will also further investigate your other symptoms to find the best course of action. In the meantime, please keep track of your symptoms and report any changes to us.

P: The patient has been treated with lamotrigine, starting at 25 mg and gradually increasing it up to 100 mg twice a day. The patient's symptoms of headaches, tingling sensation in the legs, and olfactory hallucinations have been resolved. The patient's other symptoms, such as headaches, tingling sensation in the legs, and olfactory hallucinations, persist.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
Doctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?
Patient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.
Doctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Alright. At the time of presentation, your visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure was 18 OD and 16 OS, and your pupils were 4 mm and reactive in both eyes. Your anterior exam was unremarkable, but your posterior exam in the left eye showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a BRVO.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also performed optical coherence tomography which revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in your left eye. These findings were confirmed with a fluorescein angiogram, which showed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade.
Patient: Okay, so what does that mean?
Doctor: It means there might be an issue with the blood vessels in your eye. Your blood pressure readings have been consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year, and your most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation. We also did a laboratory workup.
Patient: What did the lab results show?
Doctor: The complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, thrombin time, antithrombin activity, Protein C and S activity, cardiolipins, dilute Russell's viper venom time, homocysteine level, and a negative prothrombin G20210A mutation were all normal. Your complete metabolic panel showed a mild elevation in glucose of 121 mg/dL, and your antinuclear antibody was weakly elevated at 2.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: The results indicate that there might be an issue with your blood vessels related to your blurry vision. We will need to monitor your blood pressure and glucose levels closely and consider further testing or treatment options based on your progress.
Patient: Alright, thank you for the information.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further concerns or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to contact us.","S: Patient reports constant blurry vision in the left eye for approximately 6 weeks. Medical history includes cystic fibrosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. Patient underwent sinus surgery 7 months ago and is currently on multiple medications including albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Denies use of tobacco or drugs.
O: Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Intraocular pressure is 18 OD and 16 OS. Pupils are 4 mm and reactive bilaterally. Anterior eye exam unremarkable. Posterior exam of the left eye reveals intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Optical coherence tomography shows mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in the left eye. Fluorescein angiogram indicates delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade. Blood pressure readings over the past year range from 110/70 to 145/85. Recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9%. Laboratory workup shows normal complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, coagulation profiles, and negative prothrombin G20210A mutation. Mild elevation in glucose at 121 mg/dL and weakly positive antinuclear antibody at 2.
A: Primary diagnosis is branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in the left eye, likely exacerbated by underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Differential diagnoses could include diabetic retinopathy or other vascular occlusive disorders. The prognosis depends on the management of underlying conditions and response to treatment.
P: Plan to monitor blood pressure and glucose levels closely. Initiate or adjust antihypertensive and diabetic medications as needed. Refer to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and possible intravitreal injections or laser therapy for BRVO.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a past medical history that includes a two-year history of umbilical hernia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, gout, chronic kidney disease with proteinuria, diverticulosis, obesity, and osteoarthritis. What brings you to the clinic today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Over the past two months, I've developed pain in my umbilical hernia. The pain is localized to the periumbilical region and left lower back. It gets worse with food intake, and sometimes I take a 5 mg hydrocodone tablet to relieve it.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms in this period?
Patient: Yes, I have had nausea and lost fifteen pounds because I've been eating less.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. During your physical examination, we found a 1 cm tender and irreducible mass superior to the umbilicus. We performed a herniorrhaphy, and the gross examination of the surgical specimen did not reveal any masses or lesions. However, the microscopic evaluation showed diffuse infiltration of the connective tissue by malignant cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does that mean?
Doctor: There were also focal areas of gland formation with mucin production, which is consistent with adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry showed that the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for pancytokeratin and CK7, and negative for CK20, CDX2, TTF-1, and PSA.
Patient: What do the laboratory findings show?
Doctor: Your lab results showed elevated levels of CA 19-9 (16,590 U/mL) and CEA (14.2 ng/mL). We performed a subsequent computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast, which revealed a 5.0 × 2.7 cm ill-defined and hypoattenuating mass located in the pancreatic tail and body, with peripancreatic fat infiltration and vascular involvement of the splenic artery and vein.
Patient: Are there any other findings from the imaging?
Doctor: Yes, the imaging also showed peritoneal carcinomatosis, multiple ill-defined hypoattenuating lesions in the liver, and enlarged and hypoattenuating pericecal iliac lymph nodes.
Patient: How does my current condition compare to my prior scan?
Doctor: Your prior noncontrast computed tomography scan from four months ago showed an umbilical hernia with fat, but there were no other lesions in the pancreas and abdomen at that time.
Patient: What will be the next steps for my treatment, doctor?
Doctor: Given the findings, we need to discuss your case with a multidisciplinary team to determine the best course of action for your treatment. This may include chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. We will keep you informed and involve you in the decision-making process.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time.","S: The patient, with a history of multiple chronic conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, presents with a two-month history of pain in the umbilical hernia region, exacerbated by food intake.

P: The patient will undergo a multidisciplinary team evaluation to determine the best course of action for treatment, which may include chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. The patient will be involved in the decision-making process and informed of the diagnosis and treatment options. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the response to treatment and adjust the plan as needed. "
"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your obstetric history?
Patient: I've been pregnant 6 times, had 3 normal deliveries and 2 induced abortions.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to our emergency department today?
Patient: I've been having an acute and persistent dull pain in the right lower quadrant of my abdomen for the past few hours, and I'm really worried about it.
Doctor: I see. Are there any other symptoms you're experiencing, such as sweating, nausea, or vomiting?
Patient: Yes, I've been having rebound pain, cold sweating, and nausea, but no vomiting. There aren't any factors that seem to relieve or aggravate the pain.
Doctor: Okay. When was your last menstrual cycle?
Patient: It was about 7 weeks and 4 days ago.
Doctor: Do you have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Can you tell me about your past medical history? Have you had any infections or procedures?
Patient: I had a human papilloma virus infection, and I received 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccination about 7 years ago. I also had an intrauterine device inserted 4 years ago, was diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3, had a cervical conization procedure 3.5 years ago, and underwent laparoscopic tubal sterilization about 1 year and 4 months ago.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. During your initial physical examination, we noticed abdominal stiffness and tenderness upon palpation. We also conducted a urine pregnancy test, and it came back positive. A transvaginal ultrasound showed no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, but we did find a right adnexal mass and minimal ascites. Your lab data revealed a serum β-hCG level of 15795 million IU/mL, a white blood cell count of 12300/μL, and a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, clinical signs, imaging, and high level of serum β-hCG, we highly suspect an ectopic pregnancy. We will admit you for a surgical intervention tomorrow. However, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as vomiting, sudden syncope, or hypotension, you need to let us know immediately.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you.
[14 hours after admission]
Patient's Family Member: Doctor, my sister just experienced vomiting, sudden syncope, and her blood pressure dropped to 79/42 mm Hg. What's going on?
Doctor: We just received her latest lab test results, and her hemoglobin level has dropped to 8.9 g/dL. This, combined with her symptoms, leads us to suspect that her ectopic pregnancy may have ruptured and caused hypovolemic shock. We will need to take her for an immediate surgical intervention to manage this critical situation.
Patient's Family Member: Thank you for your prompt action, Doctor. Please do everything you can to help her.","S: The patient, a female with a history of multiple pregnancies, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3, and laparoscopic tubal sterilization, presents with acute, persistent dull pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, rebound pain, cold sweating, and nausea. She reports her last menstrual cycle was approximately 7 weeks and 4 days ago. No history of pelvic inflammatory disease or factors that relieve or aggravate the pain were noted.
O: Physical examination revealed abdominal stiffness and tenderness upon palpation. Urine pregnancy test was positive. Transvaginal ultrasound showed no intrauterine pregnancy but revealed a right adnexal mass and minimal ascites. Lab results indicated a serum β-hCG level of 15795 million IU/mL, white blood cell count of 12300/μL, and an initial hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, which later dropped to 8.9 g/dL. The patient experienced vomiting, sudden syncope, and hypotension with a blood pressure of 79/42 mm Hg.
A: The primary diagnosis is a suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy, indicated by the clinical signs, imaging results, and lab findings, particularly the elevated β-hCG and the presence of a right adnexal mass. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of acute abdomen in females, but these are less likely given the imaging and lab results.
P: Immediate surgical intervention is planned to manage the suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy and address the critical situation of hypovolemic shock. The patient will be monitored closely for any further deterioration in her condition. Post-operative care will include monitoring of hemoglobin levels and vital signs, pain management, and psychological support due to the traumatic nature of the event.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of ASD, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Can you tell me about your birth?
Patient: Yeah, I was born to non-consanguineous Caucasian parents at term by caesarean section. I weighed 6 lb, 14 oz at birth.
Doctor: Thank you. I see that your mother was on citalopram during her pregnancy for the treatment of depression. Now, let's discuss your medical history. You were diagnosed with grade five vesicoureteral reflux in infancy with a dysplastic kidney on the left, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: You also experienced absence seizures at 3 months of age and again at 9 years. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, I had those seizures, but an EEG at 9 months of age was normal. They did a computed tomography scan of my brain at three months, and it showed delayed myelination.
Doctor: I see. Your brain MRI at two and a half years showed hypoplastic olfactory nerves, a Klippel-Feil anomaly, and incomplete myelin maturation in the inferior frontal lobes and temporal tips. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: Throughout your childhood, your growth parameters were at or below the third percentile. You were hypotonic, and there was a history of severe constipation. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, I've always had trouble with constipation and didn't grow as fast as other kids.
Doctor: I also see that you had delayed developmental milestones and were diagnosed with ASD at about two and a half years. At around 11 years of age, you experienced symptoms of anxiety and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), although no official diagnosis was given. Have you tried any medications for these symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I tried several anti-anxiety medications, but none of them worked. I'm currently on resperidone.
Doctor: Have you received any behavioural therapy for these issues?
Patient: Yes, I've been in therapy since my ASD diagnosis.
Doctor: Your clinical genetic assessments at 3 and 5 years of age did not identify a specific genetic diagnosis. Clinical CMA, fragile X testing, and metabolic testing were reported to be normal. However, we have identified a de novo KMT2A frameshift variant, c.6169del (p.Val2057Tyrfs*18; Supplementary Fig.) via WGS.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Based on this information and your clinical features (Fig.), such as microcephaly, hypertrichosis, and your history of growth and developmental delay, hypotonia, constipation, and ASD, you have been diagnosed with Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WSS) at the age of 13.
Patient: I see. So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: This diagnosis helps us understand your symptoms and challenges better. We will continue to monitor your condition, and it's important to maintain your current treatments, such as behavioral therapy and medication. We'll also discuss any new recommendations or changes to your treatment plan as needed.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've been admitted for anemia and thrombocytopenia. Can you tell me about your symptoms prior to this presentation?
Patient: Yeah, about 3 weeks ago, I developed a febrile erythematous rash. Then, a week before admission, I had a fever again, and I felt really tired. I also had vomiting and non-bloody diarrhea.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. And do you have any family history of kidney or hematological disorders?
Patient: No, my parents and my three siblings are all healthy.
Doctor: That's good to know. When I examined you, I noticed you appeared pale and had bruises on your abdomen, back, and lower extremities. Your laboratory work-up showed hemolytic anemia with marked reticulocytosis, presence of schistocytes, profound thrombocytopenia, and elevated uric acid. Your serum creatinine levels were normal, though.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Furthermore, your plasma haptoglobin was undetectable, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated, and the direct Coombs test was negative. Your anti-streptolysin titers were only marginally elevated.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: Your D-dimers were increased to 2.49 μg/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units with the normal range being 0.02–0.47 μg/mL. Prothrombin, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and C3 and C4 concentrations were normal. However, your sC5b-9 was increased to 653 ng/mL, with the normal range being less than 300 ng/mL.
Patient: Oh, wow.
Doctor: We also conducted a urinalysis, which revealed microscopic erythrocyturia and mild proteinuria. On Day 2 of your stay, you received transfusions of red blood cells and platelets.
Patient: Yeah, I remember that.
Doctor: Despite the transfusions, your hemoglobin (Hb) continued to fall to 48 g/L, and your platelet count dropped to 5 × 10^9/L within 2 days.
Patient: That's not good.
Doctor: Based on all of these findings, we made a tentative diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). We administered a single dose of eculizumab, which is approximately 900 mg/m2, 2 days after admission. You were also vaccinated as a precaution.
Patient: Okay. So, what's next?
Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team to ensure the best possible outcome.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.","S: The patient, admitted for anemia and thrombocytopenia, reported a febrile erythematous rash three weeks prior and a recurrence of fever one week before admission accompanied by significant fatigue, vomiting, and non-bloody diarrhea.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea and swelling on your hands and face for at least three days. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble breathing and the swelling has been getting worse. I'm a nonsmoker and don't have any chronic diseases.
Doctor: I understand. Due to the worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia, you were initially treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation. However, since your condition worsened, you were intubated and invasive mechanical ventilation was used. On your physical examination, we auscultated mild crackles bilateral on the lower lung zones. Your chest X-ray showed bilateral nonhomogenous infiltration at the middle and lower zones.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: At first, your fraction of inhaled oxygenation (FiO2) was 80% on mechanical ventilation, but your PaO2 was 65 mmHg. We applied lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies, fluid replacement, antibiotics, and other medical treatments. Over time, your FiO2 level decreased, and you were weaned from mechanical ventilation on your fifth day in the ICU.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: After weaning, we noticed that your oral secretions increased and your left nasolabial sulcus wiped out. On your neurological examination, no abnormal findings were found except for left facial paralysis. We didn't find any pathological issues on your cranial computed tomography (CT) or cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Patient: So, what's causing the facial paralysis?
Doctor: You were diagnosed with peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) and prescribed intravenous steroid treatment of 1 milligram per kilogram methylprednisolone by a neurologist. Around the same time, a dermatological lesion occurred. On your dermatologic examination, we detected oedema on your face, pustular lesions on your skin, and a fissure on your tongue. A labium mucosal biopsy was taken, and mucositis was reported.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: When we talked about your symptoms, you informed us that you had recurrent and spontaneous facial paralysis in previous years. Based on your medical history, signs of orofacial oedema, fissure on the tongue, and PFP, you were diagnosed with MRS.
Patient: I remember having those symptoms before.
Doctor: Given your diagnosis, you were transferred from the ICU to the department of neurology for further care and treatment. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a nonsmoker with no chronic diseases, presented with dyspnea and swelling on the hands and face persisting for three days. The patient reported worsening trouble breathing and increasing swelling. The patient has a history of recurrent and spontaneous facial paralysis.
O: Initial treatment included noninvasive mechanical ventilation, escalating to intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation due to worsening condition.

Initially, FiO2 was 80% with a PaO2 of 65 mmHg. After applying lung protective strategies and other treatments, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on the fifth ICU day. Neurological examination post-weaning showed left facial paralysis with no other abnormalities; cranial CT and MRI were normal. Dermatological examination revealed facial oedema, pustular lesions, and a tongue fissure. Labium mucosal biopsy confirmed mucositis.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 50-year-old Chinese man with no prior illnesses. Can you tell me what brought you here today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having a fever, headache, and vomiting for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your brain and it showed multiple varying sizes of ring-enhancing lesions scattered in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. This suggests either a metastatic brain tumour or an infection. We also did a Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of your thorax and found a 6.5 cm x 4.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe, which is suspicious for primary lung malignancy.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, we needed to investigate further. Your blood tests showed mild leucocytosis of 11.7 x 103/uL and a normal C-reactive protein of 1.5 mg/L. We also performed a lumbar puncture to check your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It demonstrated raised intracranial pressure of 26 cm H2O, elevated cell count of 260 cells/mm3 with 90% lymphocyte predominance, low glucose of 1.9 mmol/L, and raised protein at 1.15 g/L.
Patient: What do those numbers mean, Doctor?
Doctor: These results indicate an infection. Initial mucicarmine and India Ink staining did not demonstrate organisms, but further tests detected CSF cryptococcal antigen, and CSF fungal culture grew C. gattii. Your blood cryptococcal antigen was also detected at a titre of 1:1280. Importantly, your human immunodeficiency virus testing came back negative.
Patient: So, it's an infection, not a tumor?
Doctor: That's correct. We performed a bronchoscopy to further evaluate the right upper lobe mass. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed thick-walled fungal yeast forms with narrow-based budding, consistent with Cryptococcus yeasts. These were highlighted by mucicarmine special stain. The bronchoscopic biopsies showed non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrates in the bronchial wall epithelium and lung parenchyma.
Patient: What does this mean for my treatment?
Doctor: You've been given induction anti-fungal therapy, which includes four weeks of amphotericin B and two weeks of flucytosine. After that, you'll be on maintenance therapy with oral fluconazole.
Patient: And what about the raised intracranial pressure?
Doctor: We've been performing therapeutic lumbar punctures to help treat the raised intracranial pressure. You'll continue to have these procedures during your outpatient follow-up.

"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.
Doctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.
Doctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.
Patient: Oh, that's a relief.
Doctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. 
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. 
Patient: So what's the next step, doc?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.
Patient: Alright, if that's what's needed.
Doctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.
Patient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?
Doctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our department due to worsening hoarseness over the last 8 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, along with the hoarseness, I sometimes have trouble swallowing and feel like there's a foreign body in my throat.
Doctor: I see. Upon referral, it was reported that you have been a heavy smoker for 20 years, smoking about 20 cigarettes per day. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And it seems that you also frequently consume alcohol, though not to the point of abuse. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, I do drink quite often but never really overdo it.
Doctor: In your medical history, it shows that you have arterial hypertension and are currently under treatment with beta blockers. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking them for a while now.
Doctor: Good to know. Your hematological and biochemical tests did not show any significant abnormalities. Now, let's discuss your physical examination. We performed a full head and neck examination, along with a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. The typical ear, nose, and throat examination didn't reveal any abnormal findings, and neck palpation was negative.
Patient: Okay, that's good news.
Doctor: However, the fiberoptic laryngoscopy did reveal a lesion affecting both vocal cords and the anterior commissure. Your vocal cord mobility also appeared impaired. Based on these findings, we decided to conduct a cervicothoracic and upper abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous gadolinium and scheduled you for direct microlaryngoscopy and a biopsy of the lesion under general anesthesia.
Patient: I see, so what did the imaging show?
Doctor: The imaging confirmed the laryngeal lesion, but it also indicated a second lesion about 2 cm below the inferior end of the primary one, between the first and second tracheal ring. The intermediate tissue appeared grossly normal. No signs of enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted, and laryngeal cartilages showed no abnormal findings.
Patient: So, what does that mean?
Doctor: The histopathological examination after the biopsy confirmed that you have squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is a glottic carcinoma affecting the anterior commissure and is strongly correlated with the thyroid cartilage. The lesion has infiltrated the left and the first tertile of the right vocal cord. No subglottic extension was noted. We informed you about these findings and obtained consent for radical surgical therapy.

"Doctor: Hi there, I'm the pediatric endocrinologist. I understand that your baby was referred to me because a uterus was detected on ultrasonography. Can you please provide some background information about the pregnancy and birth?
Mother: Yes, I had a difficult pregnancy. The baby was born at 23 weeks of gestation by C-section due to preeclampsia and premature membrane rupture. My husband and I are first cousins, and I've had two abortions in the past.
Doctor: I see. What was the birth weight of your baby?
Mother: He was very small, only 680 grams at birth.
Doctor: That is quite small indeed. I understand that the baby had to be intubated and given surfactant treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation support. Is that correct?
Mother: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: The baby has bilateral cryptorchidism and hypospadias, which are likely associated with the severe prematurity. Since the gender assessment at birth was made as male, the baby received a male name and identity card. Can you tell me about your maternal history during pregnancy?
Mother: I was treated with progesterone for one month between the 16th and 20th gestational weeks and also with salicylic acid throughout the pregnancy. There was no evidence of virilisation, such as acne, hirsutism, deep voice, or clitoral enlargement.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination of the baby, we found complete labioscrotal fusion and a single urogenital meatus, consistent with Prader stage-3. The gonads were not palpable, a chorda was present, and the phallus measured 2x1 cm on the dorsal and 1.6x1 cm on the ventral side. The baby is currently still in the neonatal intensive care unit and requires mechanical respiratory support. On postnatal day 30, we checked the baby's hormone levels.

I understand that your baby was referred to me because a uterus was detected on ultrasonography. Can you please provide some background information about the pregnancy and birth?\nMother: Yes, I had a difficult pregnancy. The baby was born at 23 weeks of gestation by C-section due to preeclampsia and premature membrane rupture. My husband and I are first cousins, and I've had two abortions in the past.\nDoctor: I see. What was the birth weight of your baby?\nMother: He was very small, only 680 grams at birth.\nDoctor: That is quite small indeed. I understand that the baby had to be intubated and given surfactant treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation support. Is that correct?\nMother: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: The baby has bilateral cryptorchidism and hypospadias, which are likely associated with the severe prematurity. Since the gender assessment at birth was made as male, the baby received a male name and identity card. Can you tell me about your maternal history during pregnancy?\nMother: I was treated with progesterone for one month between the 16th and 20th gestational weeks and also with salicylic acid throughout the pregnancy. There was no evidence of virilisation, such as acne, hirsutism, deep voice, or clitoral enlargement.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 72-year old female melanoma patient in disease stage IV (pT2a, N3c, M1d; AJCC 2017). Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Well, I have this bulky ulcerated tumor mass on my right upper leg, and I've been told that I have an asymptomatic singular brain metastasis, and some other suspected tumor lesions in my chest, iliac, inguinal, and lung areas.
Doctor: I see. We've also found that your serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated at 566 U/l, which is above the normal range of 135–214 U/l, and your S100B level is at 0.63 μg/l, which is higher than the normal level of < 0.2 μg/l. The BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutation analysis showed gene wild-types. Based on the tumor board recommendation, we will initiate ipilimumab (3 mg/kg body weight) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg body weight) combination therapy. This treatment is approved by the FDA for patients with BRAF V600 wild-type, unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
Patient: Oh, okay. What else is planned in terms of treatment?
Doctor: We're also planning radiotherapy for the brain lesion (stereotactic) and the bulky mass on your right upper leg. Before starting the treatment, we found that you had normal blood leucocytes and a mild C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation.
Patient: Hmm, got it. But you know, two days after starting the immunotherapy, my leg pain worsened. Is that normal?
Doctor: It's important that you mentioned that. When you came in with the worsened pain on your right upper leg, we ran some blood tests. You were in good condition without a history of chills, fever, weight loss, or malaise. However, the blood tests showed a massive leucocytosis (68,970/μl; normal range: 4,600–9,500/μl) with neutrophilia (63,420/μl; normal range: 1,800–7,200/μl). Your CRP was also elevated at 53 mg/l, which is above the normal level of < 0.5 mg/l.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?
Doctor: We took wound swabs from the ulcerated tumor on your right upper leg and found Staphylococcus aureus. To treat this, we have administered intravenously 600 clindamycine 3 times daily over 10 days.
Patient: Alright, and what about the blood smears?
Doctor: We checked the blood smears, and they do not reveal signs of leukemia, which is good news. We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

"Doctor: Hello! I understand that you've been referred to our Department from the National Organ Procurement and Transplant Network waiting list for a kidney transplant. How have you been feeling lately?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling alright, I guess. Just dealing with my hypertension and taking medication for it.
Doctor: I see. Are you currently married?
Patient: No, I'm not. I'm an unmarried office worker.
Doctor: Have you ever had any abdominal surgery?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: As per your records, you have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), but you're not currently requiring hemodialysis, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your pretransplant estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 13.7 mL/minute per 1.73 m2, and your body mass index is 21.9 kg/m2. During your physical examination, we noticed an asymptomatic bilateral flank mass. Have you experienced any discomfort or pain from this mass?
Patient: No, I haven't felt any pain or discomfort.
Doctor: We performed an abdominal MRI scan, which confirmed the presence of multiple cysts of different diameters within your significantly enlarged native kidneys. Their sagittal diameter is greater than 25 cm bilaterally. However, we don't anticipate any space constraints at the putative transplantation site in your right iliac fossa, so there's no need for a nephrectomy before the transplant.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you have a complicated cardiac history. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yes, I've been having limiting angina for quite some time now.
Doctor: I see that you are on maximally titrated medical therapy, including aspirin, prasugrel, carvedilol, ranolazine, isosorbidemononitrate (sustained release), atorvastatin, lisinopril, nitroglycerin patch, and as needed sublingual nitroglycerin. You have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And you had a coronary artery bypass graft 15 years ago, with reverse saphenous vein graft to first and second obtuse marginal arteries, and another to the posterior descending artery and posterolateral artery, is that right?
Patient: Yes, and I also had a redo CABG 2 years ago, with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD).
Doctor: I see that you also have a history of multiple stents and prior bilateral carotid endarterectomy. About 8 months ago, you were evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery, and they recommended against reoperation, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: About 4 months ago, you underwent another coronary angiography. The angiogram showed a relatively long 95% stenosis in the mid-LAD, extending from the mid-LAD to a bit passed the LIMA anastomosis, with retrograde flow into the LIMA. There was also some tenting of the LAD at the anastomotic site. Do you remember this?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: Several predilations were performed at 8 and 10 atmospheres, but there was no significant improvement to the stenosis. They then deployed a 2.25 × 28 mm Synergy drug-eluting stent (Boston Scientific) at 12 atmospheres and postdilated with a 2.25 × 20 mm noncompliant balloon at 14 atmospheres. The stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD with no residual stenosis. However, a slight kink in the distal one-third of the stent at the LIMA insertion point was noted. Do you recall this as well?
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: The movement of the intact stent during diastole and systole was also observed. Given your current situation, it's essential to continue monitoring your symptoms and maintaining your current medical therapy. If you experience any changes or worsening of your symptoms, please contact us immediately.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you, doctor.

"Doctor: Hello, we have a 60-year-old white British female patient here who was admitted to the hospital with unilateral ankle pain and swelling, stage-3 acute kidney injury (AKI), and haematuria. Was this you?
Patient: Yes, that's me. I had recently been discharged from the hospital after being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and AKI.
Doctor: I see. On admission, we initially treated you with IV fluids and started you on oral Prednisolone at 25 mg daily. Our Rheumatology team suspected a flare-up of your known rheumatoid arthritis. A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was ruled out on a venous ultrasound-Doppler. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that sounds right.
Doctor: We also conducted extensive investigations to diagnose the aetiology of the AKI. You were started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic, Tazobactam + Piperacillin, due to a positive urine dip and microscopy. The urine culture later grew Glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus sp., and based on microbiologist advice, we initiated Daptomycin at 4 mg/Kg. We discontinued Prednisolone the day before. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: Unfortunately, within fifty minutes of receiving the first dose of Daptomycin, you suffered from two tonic-clonic seizures which were five minutes apart. These lasted approximately two minutes each and both terminated spontaneously. How are you feeling now?
Patient: Hmm, I'm feeling better now, thanks.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We conducted a further neurological examination and found no focal deficit. You also experienced a single, further, generalised seizure 2 hours later for a few minutes, but no others were observed afterward. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: On that day, your mean arterial pressure was 130 mmHg, and your oxygen saturations ranged between 94 and 97%. We also recorded your elevated BP for the preceding week. Your haemoglobin was 105g/l, urea was 13.8 mmol/L, creatinine was 228 micromol/L, eGFR by MDRD was 19ml/min, and C-reactive protein was 14 i.u. Your liver function tests, calcium, and phosphate were normal. We also performed a CT-scan of your head. 
Patient: Okay, thank you for letting me know.
Doctor: You're welcome. Based on your progress and our findings, we'll continue to monitor you closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Please continue to inform us of any changes in your condition or symptoms you may experience.
Patient: Yes, I will. Thank you, doctor.","S: 60-year-old white British female presents with unilateral ankle pain and swelling, stage-3 acute kidney injury (AKI), and haematuria.

Was this you?\nPatient: Yes, that's me. I had recently been discharged from the hospital after being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and AKI.\nDoctor: I see. On admission, we initially treated you with IV fluids and started you on oral Prednisolone at 25 mg daily. Our Rheumatology team suspected a flare-up of your known rheumatoid arthritis. A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was ruled out on a venous ultrasound-Doppler. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that sounds right.\nDoctor: We also conducted extensive investigations to diagnose the aetiology of the AKI. You were started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic, Tazobactam + Piperacillin, due to a positive urine dip and microscopy. The urine culture later grew Glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus sp., and based on microbiologist advice, we initiated Daptomycin at 4 mg/Kg. We discontinued Prednisolone the day before. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, within fifty minutes of receiving the first dose of Daptomycin, you suffered from two tonic-clonic seizures which were five minutes apart. These lasted approximately two minutes each and both terminated spontaneously. How are you feeling now?\nPatient: Hmm, I'm feeling better now, thanks.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. We conducted a further neurological examination and found no focal deficit. You also experienced a single, further, generalised seizure 2 hours later for a few minutes, but no others were observed afterward. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: On that day, your mean arterial pressure was 130 mmHg, and your oxygen saturations ranged between 94 and 97%. We also recorded your elevated BP for the preceding week. Your haemoglobin was 105g/l, urea was 13.8 mmol/L, creatinine was 228 micromol/L, eGFR by MDRD was 19ml/min, and C-reactive protein was 14 i.u. Your liver function tests, calcium, and phosphate were normal. We also performed a CT-scan of your head. \nPatient: Okay, thank you for letting me know.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Based on your progress and our findings, we'll continue to monitor you closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. You've been referred to our retina department for bilateral vision loss. Can you tell me about the medications you're currently taking?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking klopidogrel, ramipril, amlodipin, atorvastatin, gliclazide, and metformin for a prolonged period of time.
Doctor: Okay, thank you. After conducting a fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, we found that you have a ciliary artery occlusion in your left eye, resulting in a visual acuity of 20/200. Your right eye has an occult choroidal neovascular membrane with subretinal fluid. We performed three monthly intravitreal RAN injections to treat it. Have you noticed any improvement in your vision since the treatments?
Patient: Yes, after the third injection, my vision improved from 20/32 to 20/25.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We also observed a decrease in your central macular thickness. However, I understand that you've been experiencing a generalized, excessively pruriginous skin eruption on your trunk, lumbar region, and extensor aspects of your upper and lower extremities. Did these eruptions worsen after the third injection?
Patient: Yes, the lesions got worse after the third injection.
Doctor: I see. We conducted laboratory examinations, which showed mild hyperlipidemia with cholesterol at 241 mg/dl and triglycerides at 256 mg/dl. Your blood glucose level was 155 mg/dl, and your HbA1C was 6.6%. In the dermatological examination, we found a generalized, erythematous rash with umblicated papules, many of which had ridge-like borders, and some containing keratin plugs. We also performed a skin biopsy.
Patient: What did the skin biopsy show?
Doctor: The biopsy demonstrated a cup-shaped depression of the epidermis associated with a keratin plug containing compact ortho- and parakeratosis with granular nuclear debris. Altered collagen fibers were seen in the underlying dermis, with focal extrusion through the epidermis. Based on these clinical and histological findings, you were diagnosed with acquired reactive perforating collagenosis (ARPC).
Patient: Was this caused by the injections?
Doctor: Yes, we performed a challenge test, which indicated that the rash and pruritus started after the injections. Unfortunately, you had a poor response to topical steroids to treat the rash.
Patient: What's the next step for treatment?
Doctor: We will proceed with 22 sessions of NBUVB therapy to help alleviate your symptoms. Please continue to monitor your vision and let us know if you experience any changes or worsening symptoms.","S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, reports bilateral vision loss.

He has experienced improvement in vision in the right eye from 20/32 to 20/25 after three monthly intravitreal RAN injections. Additionally, he reports a worsening generalized, pruriginous skin eruption post-injection.
O: Fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography revealed ciliary artery occlusion in the left eye with a visual acuity of 20/200, and an occult choroidal neovascular membrane with subretinal fluid in the right eye.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with a history of right knee pain for a 3-month duration. Can you tell me if you've experienced any trauma or undue exercise recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any trauma or done any excessive exercise.
Doctor: Alright, let me do a physical examination. I've noticed joint effusion and a limited range of motion in your right knee. Have you experienced any locking in the joint or felt a palpable mass?
Patient: No, there's no locking or any mass that I can feel.
Doctor: And do you have any other significant past history that I should be aware of?
Patient: No, I don't have any other significant past history.
Doctor: I see that you haven't received any conservative treatments or plain x-radiography. Based on an MRI of your right knee, there's an intra-articular lesion located around the posterior cruciate ligament. The lesion shows iso-intensity or lower intensity compared to surrounding muscle in T1 weighted MRIs, and high signal intensity in T2 weighted MRIs (Fig. ). The preoperative differential diagnoses could be synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, or malignant soft tissue tumour.
Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We're planning to perform an arthroscopy operation to remove the lesion and obtain a biopsy to test for malignant soft tissue tumour. If it's positive for malignancy, additional wide extra-articular resection would be needed, and artificial joints were prepared.
Patient: Alright, what happened during the arthroscopy?
Doctor: During the arthroscopy of your right knee, we found synovial hyperplasia inflammation and the mass in front of the right posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. ). We excised the lesion and performed a partial synovectomy.
Patient: What were the findings of the biopsy?
Doctor: Macroscopically, the right knee mass was a piece of grey-red tissue measuring 2.5 cm by 2 cm by 1 cm in size. The antibodies, clones, dilutions, pretreatment conditions, and sources are listed in Table . On microscopic examination (Fig. ), the tumour consisted of a bland fibroblastic proliferation arranged in irregular fasciitis with tissue-culture-like appearance. The stroma varied from focally myxoid with microcyst formation to collagenous. Extravasated erythrocytes and small lymphocytes were present throughout the lesion. No areas of necrosis or atypical mitosis were seen.
Patient: What about the immunohistochemistry results?
Doctor: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the cells were positive in patches for SMA and negative for S100, desmin, CK(AE1/AE3), and nuclear (Fig. ).
Patient: So, what does all this mean for me?
Doctor: Based on these findings, it appears that the lesion is not malignant, which is good news. We will continue to monitor your recovery and let you know if any additional treatments or follow-ups are needed. Be sure to report any changes in your symptoms or new concerns.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient reports a 3-month history of right knee pain without any preceding trauma or excessive exercise. The patient denies any joint locking or palpable mass and has no significant past medical history.

Can you tell me if you've experienced any trauma or undue exercise recently?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trauma or done any excessive exercise.\nDoctor: Alright, let me do a physical examination. I've noticed joint effusion and a limited range of motion in your right knee. Have you experienced any locking in the joint or felt a palpable mass?\nPatient: No, there's no locking or any mass that I can feel.\nDoctor: And do you have any other significant past history that I should be aware of?\nPatient: No, I don't have any other significant past history.\nDoctor: I see that you haven't received any conservative treatments or plain x-radiography. Based on an MRI of your right knee, there's an intra-articular lesion located around the posterior cruciate ligament. The lesion shows iso-intensity or lower intensity compared to surrounding muscle in T1 weighted MRIs, and high signal intensity in T2 weighted MRIs (Fig. ). The preoperative differential diagnoses could be synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, or malignant soft tissue tumour.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We're planning to perform an arthroscopy operation to remove the lesion and obtain a biopsy to test for malignant soft tissue tumour. If it's positive for malignancy, additional wide extra-articular resection would be needed, and artificial joints were prepared.\nPatient: Alright, what happened during the arthroscopy?\nDoctor: During the arthroscopy of your right knee, we found synovial hyperplasia inflammation and the mass in front of the right posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. ). We excised the lesion and performed a partial synovectomy.\nPatient: What were the findings of the biopsy?\nDoctor: Macroscopically, the right knee mass was a piece of grey-red tissue measuring 2.5 cm by 2 cm by 1 cm in size. The antibodies, clones, dilutions, pretreatment conditions, and sources are listed in Table . On microscopic examination (Fig. ), the tumour consisted of a bland fibroblastic proliferation arranged in irregular fasciitis with tissue-culture-like appearance. The stroma varied from focally myxoid with microcyst formation to collagenous. Extravasated erythrocytes and small lymphocytes were present throughout the lesion. No areas of necrosis or atypical mitosis were seen.\nPatient: What about the immunohistochemistry results?\nDoctor: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the cells were positive in patches for SMA and negative for S100, desmin, CK(AE1/AE3), and nuclear (Fig. ).\nPatient: So, what does all this mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, it appears that the lesion is not malignant, which is good news. We will continue to monitor your recovery and let you know if any additional treatments or follow-ups are needed. Be sure to report any changes in your symptoms or new concerns.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 36-year-old woman with a weight of 50 kg and a height of 147 cm. You've been diagnosed with CIPA and are scheduled for revision of your left total hip arthroplasty. Can you tell me about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, ever since I was born, I've had recurrent episodes of unexplained fever, anhidrosis, burns, and bone fractures.
Doctor: I see. You've also previously undergone 7 operations for spinal deformity and 1 operation of total hip arthroplasty on both sides, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Although you lack general diaphoresis and thermal nociception, you mentioned that you perform body surface cooling at your own discretion when you feel at risk of hyperthermia, and your body temperature is kept approximately at 36°C?
Patient: Yeah, I do that to prevent overheating.
Doctor: Good to know. We didn't observe any signs of mental retardation or orthostatic hypotension. Also, no abnormalities were detected on your chest radiographs and electrocardiograms. Your blood biochemistry showed no abnormality except mild anemia, indicated by a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dl.
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: No premedication was administered before your surgery. After you were brought into the operating room, we started routine monitoring and measurement of the bispectral index (BIS). Your body temperature was measured at the urinary bladder, esophagus, and precordial skin and controlled by a hot-air-type heater.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We administered Propofol at an effect-site concentration of 4 μg/ml by target-controlled infusion. After muscle relaxation was achieved by the administration of 50 mg of rocuronium, your trachea was intubated.
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: Immediately after endotracheal intubation, your systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 145 mmHg, and your heart rate increased from 60 to 95 beats per minute (bpm). Two minutes later, your systolic blood pressure had decreased to 125 mmHg. Propofol was continuously infused intravenously at a target concentration of 2 to 4 μg/ml, and BIS levels were maintained between 40 and 60.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: After an arterial catheter was placed, your position was changed from the supine to the right lateral position. Surgery was then started.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Since no circulatory change associated with pain occurred during surgery, opioids were not administered. Regarding hemodynamics, everything was stable throughout the procedure.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Yes, the surgery went well. Please make sure to follow up with us for any post-operative concerns or further treatment. Do you have any questions?
Patient: No, I think you covered everything. Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome.

She actively manages her risk of hyperthermia through body surface cooling, maintaining her body temperature at approximately 36°C. She has undergone multiple surgeries, including 7 for spinal deformity and bilateral total hip arthroplasty.
O: The patient's weight is 50 kg, and height is 147 cm. Recent surgical monitoring showed stable vital signs with a noted increase in systolic blood pressure from 130 to 145 mmHg and heart rate from 60 to 95 bpm immediately post-intubation, which later stabilized. Hemoglobin level was mildly low at 10.6 g/dl. No abnormalities were detected in chest radiographs and electrocardiograms. During surgery, no circulatory changes associated with pain were observed, and hemodynamics remained stable.
A: Primary diagnosis is CIPA with complications including recurrent bone fractures and requirement for multiple orthopedic surgeries. Differential diagnosis should consider other neuropathies, but clinical history and presentation strongly support CIPA. Prognosis includes ongoing risk of injuries related to insensitivity to pain and temperature, necessitating continuous monitoring and preventive care.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I'm a 65-year-old man and I've been experiencing reduced vision in both my eyes lately.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history? Have you had any conditions or treatments in the past?
Patient: Yes, I was treated for small cell cancer of the lung and had chemotherapy for it. Seven months ago, I had breathlessness and a pleural effusion was found during a routine examination. They also discovered a mycobacterial infection in the pleura.
Doctor: It looks like you were treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and INH for the mycobacterial infection. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. But I had drug-induced hepatitis, so they changed my regimen to rifampicin and ethambutol with the addition of levofloxacin.
Doctor: Alright, let's start by examining your eyes. First, we'll check your best-corrected visual acuity, which is 6/15 in both eyes. Your extraocular movements and anterior segment examination seem normal. Now, I'll perform a dilated fundus examination. That looks normal as well.
Patient: So, what could be causing my reduced vision?
Doctor: Let's conduct a visual-evoked potential (VEP) test to get a better understanding of your condition. The VEP results show reduced amplitude and prolonged latency in both eyes, suggestive of bilateral optic axonopathy.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there might be some damage to the optic nerves in both your eyes. To further investigate this, we'll need to do an MRI scan.
Patient: Okay, what did the MRI scan show?
Doctor: The MRI scan revealed multiple round peripherally enhancing lesions in both cerebral hemispheres and in the right cerebellum. Moreover, Central 30-2 perimetry revealed an incomplete left homonymous hemianopia with additional inferior temporal defects in the right eye.
Patient: Is it related to the medications I've been taking?
Doctor: Yes, based on these findings, it seems that ethambutol toxicity is the likely cause of your reduced vision, as the lesions in the cerebral hemispheres are not consistent with the perimetric findings.
Patient: What should I do now? Are there any treatment options?
Doctor: There are treatments available, but it's important to discuss them with your primary care physician and consider discontinuing ethambutol. However, I must let you know that the decision to proceed with any treatment is ultimately up to you.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll think about it and let you know if I decide to go ahead with the treatment.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care.","S: The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with reduced vision in both eyes. He has a history of small cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy, pleural effusion, and a mycobacterial infection treated with multiple antibiotics, including ethambutol.

Your physical exam showed cervical lymphadenopathy as well. We have also conducted some laboratory tests.
Patient: What did the tests show?
Doctor: Your lab results revealed segmented neutrophil predominant leukocytosis, elevated levels of troponin (2.45 ng/ml), BNP (457.2 pg/ml), and d-dimer (6.72 µg/ml). Your Electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia with possible left atrial enlargement. Based on these findings, we have initiated Vasopressor support and an unfractionated heparin drip, and you have been admitted to the intensive care unit for further management.
Patient: I see. What about the imaging tests?
Doctor: Imaging tests showed a low-probability VQ scan for pulmonary embolism and severe diffuse myocardial hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20–25% without pericardial effusion. Your CT abdomen showed generalized lymphadenopathy and mild hepatosplenomegaly. However, your chest X-ray was negative for any acute pathology on admission.
Patient: Did you run any tests for autoimmune diseases?
Doctor: Yes, we performed a detailed rheumatologic workup, which was unremarkable. This included tests for antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA, antiproteinase 3, antimyeloperoxidase, and C3 and C4 levels.
Patient: What's the next step in my treatment?
Doctor: We performed a right heart catheterization, which demonstrated elevated wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular pressure. These findings are consistent with acute left ventricular failure and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. With a presumptive diagnosis, we will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment accordingly.

Based on your vitals, you're currently febrile with a temperature of 102.0°F, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg, and tachycardic at a rate of 149 bpm. Your physical exam showed cervical lymphadenopathy as well. We have also conducted some laboratory tests.\nPatient: What did the tests show?\nDoctor: Your lab results revealed segmented neutrophil predominant leukocytosis, elevated levels of troponin (2.45 ng/ml), BNP (457.2 pg/ml), and d-dimer (6.72 µg/ml). Your Electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia with possible left atrial enlargement. Based on these findings, we have initiated Vasopressor support and an unfractionated heparin drip, and you have been admitted to the intensive care unit for further management.\nPatient: I see. What about the imaging tests?\nDoctor: Imaging tests showed a low-probability VQ scan for pulmonary embolism and severe diffuse myocardial hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20–25% without pericardial effusion. Your CT abdomen showed generalized lymphadenopathy and mild hepatosplenomegaly. However, your chest X-ray was negative for any acute pathology on admission.\nPatient: Did you run any tests for autoimmune diseases?\nDoctor: Yes, we performed a detailed rheumatologic workup, which was unremarkable. This included tests for antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA, antiproteinase 3, antimyeloperoxidase, and C3 and C4 levels.\nPatient: What's the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: We performed a right heart catheterization, which demonstrated elevated wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular pressure. These findings are consistent with acute left ventricular failure and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. With a presumptive diagnosis, we will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment accordingly.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the thorough explanation.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to help you recover. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.""}

Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Are there any other symptoms or signs you'd like to report?
Patient: No, that's about it.
Doctor: Alright, let me perform a clinical examination to see if I can identify the issue. Please open your mouth and say ""ahh.""
Patient: Ahh.
Doctor: Upon examination, I found a bulky mass localized to your left tonsillar bed. However, there is no presence of mucosal ulceration.
Patient: Oh, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there is a growth in your tonsil area, but there is no ulceration in the mucous membrane. Additionally, there is no clinical evidence of any pathological cervical lymph nodes.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: I would like to schedule a maxillofacial CT scan and an MRI for further evaluation.
Patient: Okay, when should I schedule those?
Doctor: As soon as possible, so we can determine the cause of your dysphagia and devise an appropriate treatment plan.
Patient: Alright, thank you for your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll discuss the results of the CT scan and MRI once they're complete, and determine the best course of action.","S: The patient reports a 4-month history of difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) without associated pain or hemoptysis. No other symptoms were reported.
O: Clinical examination revealed a bulky mass in the left tonsillar bed without mucosal ulceration or pathological cervical lymph nodes. Further diagnostic imaging with a maxillofacial CT scan and MRI has been recommended.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doc. I'm an HIV-1-infected 41-year-old male farmer. Recently, I've been experiencing right hypochondriac abdominal pain for about five days. Along with that, I have decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and yellowish discolouration of my sclera for the last two days.
Doctor: I see. Are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing, such as fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or any difficulty or pain while swallowing?
Patient: No, I haven't had any fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or odynophagia or dysphagia.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. I see that you first presented to us back in September 2016, when you were diagnosed with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis (PJP) on transbronchial lung biopsy. You were successfully treated with co-trimoxazole and prednisolone. The biopsy didn't reveal any CMV inclusion bodies at that time. Your CD4 count was 109/μL, and your HIV-1 viral load was 4.89 log copies/ml. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: You were initially diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in 2000 and treated by another physician. You were started on zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP), and then switched to tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), 3TC, atazanavir, and ritonavir (ATV/r) in 2011 due to virological failure. After controlling your PJP, we switched your HAART to raltegravir (RAL), darunavir (DRV), and ritonavir based on the genotypic resistance report. 
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: So, within four weeks of initiating the new HAART regimen, you've presented with these current symptoms. Your physical examination showed icterus and tender hepatomegaly, but fundoscopy did not reveal any CMV retinitis. You have normocytic normochromic anaemia with a haemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dl, and your total leucocyte and differential counts are within normal range.
Patient: Okay, and what about my liver?
Doctor: Your liver enzymes are as follows: total bilirubin is 9.2 mg/dl (reference value: 0-1 mg/dl); aspartate transaminase (AST) is 109 U/L [15–37 U/L]; alanine transaminase (ALT) is 41 U/L (14–59 U/L); and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is 90 U/L. 
Patient: Hmm, so what does all this mean, Doc?
Doctor: These results indicate that you have elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which could be contributing to your symptoms. We will need to investigate further to determine the cause and appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, please continue taking your current medications and report any new or worsening symptoms.
Patient: Alright, Doc. Thank you for the information. I'll keep you updated on my condition.","S: The patient is a 41-year-old male farmer with a history of HIV-1 infection, reporting right hypochondriac abdominal pain for five days, accompanied by decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and yellowish discoloration of the sclera for the last two days. He denies fever, diarrhea, blurring of vision, odynophagia, or dysphagia. His medical history includes pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis treated with co-trimoxazole and prednisolone, and a history of virological failure managed with multiple antiretroviral therapies.
O: Physical examination revealed icterus and tender hepatomegaly. No CMV retinitis was observed on fundoscopy. Laboratory results showed normocytic normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dl. Total bilirubin was significantly elevated at 9.2 mg/dl, AST was elevated at 109 U/L, ALT was within normal limits at 41 U/L, and ALP was 90 U/L. The patient's CD4 count and HIV-1 viral load from previous records were 109/μL and 4.89 log copies/ml, respectively.
A: The primary assessment is acute hepatitis, likely drug-induced given the recent change in HAART regimen and elevated liver enzymes. Differential diagnoses include viral hepatitis, biliary tract disease, and other hepatobiliary disorders. The absence of fever and specific infectious symptoms slightly lowers the likelihood of infectious hepatitis.
P: Continue current HAART regimen while monitoring symptoms and liver function closely. Schedule an immediate follow-up for additional hepatic function tests and an abdominal ultrasound to assess liver and biliary tract structure. Educate the patient on the signs of worsening liver disease and the importance of adherence to the prescribed treatment. Consider consultation with a hepatologist if liver enzymes continue to rise or symptoms worsen.",Create a medical SOAP summary of this dialogue.,"[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert medical professor assisting in the creation of medically accurate SOAP summaries.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been referred to our service for further management of your recurrent germ cell malignancy. Can you tell me about your initial symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I first noticed some abdominal bloating and I was told there was an 18-cm mass in my adnexal area.
Doctor: That's correct. Your tumor marker elevation at that time showed Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at 131.53 ng/mL, CA 125 at 521 U/mL, and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 242 IU/L. You underwent a fertility-sparing staging surgery which included a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, unilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, and cul-de-sac tumor excision. Then, you received chemotherapy with 4 cycles of BEP, which is bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Is that right?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I was 14 years old when all of that happened.
Doctor: The final pathology reported a mixed germ cell tumor, mainly composed of immature teratoma (grade 3, FIGO stage IIIC, pT3cN0M0) with components of embryonal carcinoma (23%) and yolk sac tumor (3%). Now, during your follow-up, disease recurrence was suspected due to tumor marker elevation again (AFP: 118.82 ng/mL, CA 125: 58.82 U/mL) and pelvic cystic lesions with ascites on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. That's why you were referred to us. Have you noticed any new symptoms lately?
Patient: I haven't noticed anything major, but I do feel some discomfort in my pelvic area occasionally.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. In order to address the recurrence, you underwent a second fertility-sparing debulking surgery at our hospital. The intra-operative findings showed a 6 × 5-cm solid tumor at your omentum, another gray tan soft tissue measuring 5 × 3 cm upon your bladder, and some small cul-de-sac tumors. There was no residual disease noted. Do you have any questions about the surgery?
Patient: No, I think I understand what happened. What were the results of the surgery?
Doctor: All the lesions were reported to be metastatic mixed germ cell tumors, mainly composed of an immature teratoma with focal areas of yolk sac tumors. The teratoma component is made up of squamous epithelium, intestinal-type epithelium, respiratory epithelium, mesenchymal tissue, and neuroglial tissue. The immature element is found focally and is composed of fetal-type epithelium and mesenchymal tissue. 
Patient: Oh, I see. What does this mean for my condition?
Doctor: It means that the surgery was successful in removing the recurrent tumors. We will continue to monitor your tumor markers and perform regular CT scans to ensure there is no further recurrence. It's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and report any changes or concerns to us.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me.

"Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today?
Patient: Well, I've been severely affected by some mobility and balance issues since I was a kid.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me when you first started to notice these difficulties?
Patient: My parents first noticed my mobility and balance difficulties when I was around 2 years and 7 months old. I started walking independently at 8 months, but I could never ride a bicycle.
Doctor: Hmm, that must have been challenging. Have you experienced any problems with activities that require fine motor skills, like using your hands?
Patient: Yes, I've always had significant problems with fine motor activity of both hands. Since childhood, I've been unable to cut food by myself.
Doctor: I understand. What kind of mobility aids do you use to help you get around?
Patient: I require a pedestal walker and long leg braces to ambulate.
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your voice over the years?
Patient: My voice has been hoarse since I was 16, and I have documented vocal cord paralysis. I also develop shortness of breath after speaking for several minutes.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I got this high voltage electrical burn on my scalp and I was treated with dressing for 10 days in another hospital. But now, I have a fever and an infected wound.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of immune compromise?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Alright. We'll have to do a debridement of your scalp to remove the infected tissue. Unfortunately, even after the debridement, you may still have a sustained fever and raised counts.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Two days after the debridement, we'll do a clinical examination. We might find hyphae over the wound margin and gangrenous changes over your scalp surrounding the wound.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, this could be an invasive fungal infection called zygomycosis. We'll start you on an injection of amphotericin B and take you for a wide debridement. We'll also take a tissue biopsy for histopathology examination.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: During the procedure, we'll perform outer bony cortex chiseling with a high-speed diamond burr. The histopathology report will help us identify the specific fungus causing the infection, which in your case is A. corymbifera. Intravenous amphotericin B injection will be continued for a 4-week period since diagnosis to complete healing.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: After two weeks of anti-fungal treatment, your clinical condition should improve. Once we confirm the absence of the fungal infection, we'll cover the scalp defect with a free anterior lateral thigh flap.
Patient: Oh, that's good news.
Doctor: Yes, the recipient vessels will be the superior temporal artery and vein. In the post-operative period, you'll continue to receive intravenous amphotericin B injection for 2 more weeks.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: The post-operative period should be uneventful, and your condition will improve over time. Just make sure to follow our instructions carefully and keep an eye on your symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello there, I see you have a history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. What brings you here today?
Patient: Well, I was admitted to the hospital after an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. I was treated with unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
Doctor: I understand. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: On the fourth day, I developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The doctors did a DVT and pulmonary embolism workup.
Doctor: And what did they find?
Patient: They found both a DVT and a subocclusive saddle-shaped pulmonary embolism. They started me on a continuous heparin infusion for treatment.
Doctor: I see. Did you experience any other symptoms after that?
Patient: Yes, the following day, I developed sudden left-sided weakness and rightward gaze deviation.
Doctor: That sounds concerning. It seems like you had an acute ischemic stroke. Did they perform any imaging tests to confirm this?
Patient: Yes, they did a CT angiogram of the head and neck and an MRI of my brain. They found that the stroke was caused by right-sided common carotid artery occlusion with thrombus extending into the external and internal carotid arteries.
Doctor: Did they find anything else on the imaging?
Patient: They also noted a tandem occlusion of the inferior branch of the right middle cerebral artery on cerebral angiography.
Doctor: So, what was the next step in your treatment?
Patient: The doctors performed a successful mechanical thrombectomy of the right carotid artery bifurcation thrombus.
Doctor: That's great to hear. How did your platelet count look after the procedure?
Patient: My platelet count dropped from 153,000/µL to 94,000/µL, which raised suspicion for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. They stopped the heparin infusion and started me on continuous bivalirudin infusion instead.
Doctor: Did they perform any additional tests to confirm the suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia?
Patient: Yes, they sent PF4-H AB and SRA tests.
Doctor: What were the results of those tests?
Patient: The tests came back negative, and my platelet count started to uptrend to 105,000/µL.
Doctor: That's good news. Since the tests were negative, what was their next step?
Patient: They stopped the bivalirudin infusion and restarted me on therapeutic continuous heparin infusion due to reduced suspicion of HIT.
Doctor: Did they perform any other tests during your stay at the hospital?
Patient: Yes, they did a transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study, which revealed a patent foramen ovale with right to left shunting. They think the cause of my stroke was a paradoxical embolism.
Doctor: I see. How has your platelet count been since then?
Patient: From day 8, my platelets started to downtrend to 36,000/µL.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing your experience. We'll continue to monitor your platelet count and adjust your treatment accordingly.","S: The patient, with a history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture and received unfractionated heparin for DVT prophylaxis. On the fourth day post-operation, the patient developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia, leading to a diagnosis of DVT and a subocclusive saddle-shaped pulmonary embolism. The following day, the patient experienced sudden left-sided weakness and rightward gaze deviation, indicative of an acute ischemic stroke. The patient reports these symptoms were confirmed by CT angiogram and MRI, showing right-sided common carotid artery occlusion and a tandem occlusion of the inferior branch of the right middle cerebral artery.
O: Initial platelet count was 153,000/µL, which dropped to 94,000/µL post-thrombectomy, raising suspicion for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, PF4-H AB and SRA tests were negative, and platelet count improved to 105,000/µL. The patient was restarted on a therapeutic continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study revealed a patent foramen ovale with right to left shunting, suggesting a paradoxical embolism as the cause of the stroke. The patient's platelet count later downtrended to 36,000/µL.
A: The primary diagnosis is acute ischemic stroke secondary to a paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale, complicated by a pulmonary embolism and DVT. Differential diagnosis included HIT, which was ruled out with negative PF4-H AB and SRA tests. The patient's fluctuating platelet count remains a concern for ongoing monitoring.
P: Continue monitoring the platelet count and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary. Maintain therapeutic heparin infusion while monitoring for any signs of bleeding or thrombocytopenia. Consider consultation with a hematologist for platelet management and a cardiologist for evaluation of the patent foramen ovale. Educate the patient on the signs of stroke recurrence and the importance of adhering to the anticoagulation therapy regimen.

What brings you here today?\nPatient: Well, I was admitted to the hospital after an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. I was treated with unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.\nDoctor: I understand. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: On the fourth day, I developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The doctors did a DVT and pulmonary embolism workup.\nDoctor: And what did they find?\nPatient: They found both a DVT and a subocclusive saddle-shaped pulmonary embolism. They started me on a continuous heparin infusion for treatment.\nDoctor: I see. Did you experience any other symptoms after that?\nPatient: Yes, the following day, I developed sudden left-sided weakness and rightward gaze deviation.\nDoctor: That sounds concerning. It seems like you had an acute ischemic stroke. Did they perform any imaging tests to confirm this?\nPatient: Yes, they did a CT angiogram of the head and neck and an MRI of my brain. They found that the stroke was caused by right-sided common carotid artery occlusion with thrombus extending into the external and internal carotid arteries.\nDoctor: Did they find anything else on the imaging?\nPatient: They also noted a tandem occlusion of the inferior branch of the right middle cerebral artery on cerebral angiography.\nDoctor: So, what was the next step in your treatment?\nPatient: The doctors performed a successful mechanical thrombectomy of the right carotid artery bifurcation thrombus.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

A: The primary diagnosis is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with a thrombus in the right carotid artery bifurcation. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of stroke, but the negative platelet count and negative test results suggest HIT. The patient's history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus further supports this diagnosis.
P: The patient was treated with unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Heparin was stopped, and the patient was restarted on therapeutic continuous heparin infusion due to reduced suspicion of HIT. The patient's platelet count has been stable at 36,000/µL since day 8.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with a history of macrocephaly and ataxia. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble with my balance and coordination for about six weeks now.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm losing some vision on the sides.
Doctor: We performed an eye examination and although there wasn't any papilledema, it was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision. Were there any issues in your past medical history?
Patient: No, I've been healthy and developing normally.
Doctor: Alright. At presentation, you did not have diencephalic syndrome. We conducted a brain MRI which demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass, centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm, measuring 5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm. This mass has some effect on the midbrain and third ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We performed an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to manage your hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma. It was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing.
Patient: What does that mean for my treatment?
Doctor: We started you on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin. Unfortunately, your tumor showed rapid progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy.
Patient: Oh, that's not good.
Doctor: No, it's not. Due to the progression, you developed further complications like progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second VP shunt.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: After extensive discussions and mutual expert consensus, we decided to stop your chemotherapy and start you on a novel targeted agent called dabrafenib at 5.25mg/kg/day. Three months into dabrafenib, your tumor size decreased by more than 70% to 2.5cm x 3.5cm x 2.7cm, with continued decline until plateauing after two years of therapy.
Patient: Wow, that's great news!
Doctor: Yes, it is. Prior to dabrafenib, you had marked motor and speech impairments, but now you're able to perform all age-appropriate developmental skills independently.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've been referred to Clinical Genetics for an evaluation of your son's history of developmental delay. Can you tell me more about the symptoms he's been experiencing?
Patient's mother: Yes, he is our second child, and his development has been slower than usual. He began to walk and speak at 14 months of age, but he still doesn't know the alphabet, colors, or numbers.
Doctor: I understand. It's important to note that your family's pedigree is remarkable as your maternal male first cousin also required special education for learning disabilities. Regarding your son's prenatal history, you had a chlamydia infection at 3 months gestational age, is that correct?
Patient's mother: Yes, that's correct. I was treated with antibiotics for the infection.
Doctor: Your son was born vaginally at 37 weeks gestational age, weighing 1.98 kg, and spent a total of 23 days in the NICU requiring nasogastric feeds and phototherapy. Is that accurate?
Patient's mother: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your son was diagnosed with global developmental delay by a behavioral pediatrician and began early intervention services at 2 years of age, receiving occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Currently, he is in special education classes and is getting speech and occupational therapies. Can he understand directions and point to body parts?
Patient's mother: Yes, he can do that.
Doctor: In addition to these developmental delays, your son has a history of anemia, which is followed by his pediatrician. On physical exam, we found that he has a low anterior hairline, slightly downward slanting palpebral fissures, infraorbital puffiness, overfolded helices bilaterally, a broad nasal bridge, a wide grin, and a thin upper lip, which generally resembled your facial features.
Patient's mother: Yes, I've noticed those similarities too.
Doctor: We performed Clinical Fragile X testing on your son's DNA, and it came back normal with 29 CGG repeats. However, CMA testing using the SurePrint G3 ISCA CGH + SNP 4 × 180 microarray detected a heterozygous 1.21 Mb deletion of chromosome 3q29.
Patient's mother: What does that mean for my son?
Doctor: This genetic finding could be related to his developmental delays and other symptoms. We will need to continue monitoring his progress and providing the appropriate therapies to help him overcome these challenges.
Patient's mother: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. What are the next steps for my son's care?
Doctor: We will continue to work closely with his pediatrician and therapists to ensure he receives the appropriate support, and we will schedule regular follow-up appointments with our genetics team to monitor his progress.
Patient's mother: I appreciate your help, doctor. We will do everything we can to support our son.
Doctor: You're doing a great job, and we're here to help you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient's mother reports that her son, the second child, has experienced developmental delays, notably in walking and speaking, which began at 14 months. He currently lacks knowledge of the alphabet, colors, or numbers. The family history includes a maternal male first cousin with learning disabilities. The patient had a prenatal history of maternal chlamydia infection treated with antibiotics. He was born prematurely at 37 weeks, with a low birth weight, and required extended NICU care including nasogastric feeds and phototherapy. He was diagnosed with global developmental delay, has been receiving early intervention services since age 2, and is currently in special education with ongoing speech and occupational therapies. He can understand directions and identify body parts. There is also a history of anemia.
O: Physical examination revealed features such as a low anterior hairline, downward slanting palpebral fissures, infraorbital puffiness, overfolded helices, a broad nasal bridge, a wide grin, and a thin upper lip, resembling maternal features. Genetic testing showed normal Fragile X with 29 CGG repeats. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) detected a heterozygous 1.21 Mb deletion on chromosome 3q29.
A: The primary diagnosis is global developmental delay, likely associated with the chromosomal deletion detected (3q29 deletion syndrome), which can explain the developmental delays and dysmorphic features. Differential diagnoses could include other genetic syndromes, but these are less likely given the specific chromosomal finding.
P: The management plan includes continued support through special education and ongoing speech and occupational therapy. Regular follow-up appointments with the genetics team will be scheduled to monitor his development and adjust care as needed. Collaboration with the pediatrician to manage his anemia and overall health will continue. The family will be educated about the genetic findings and implications for care and development.

Can you tell me more about the symptoms he's been experiencing?\nPatient's mother: Yes, he is our second child, and his development has been slower than usual. He began to walk and speak at 14 months of age, but he still doesn't know the alphabet, colors, or numbers.\nDoctor: I understand. It's important to note that your family's pedigree is remarkable as your maternal male first cousin also required special education for learning disabilities. Regarding your son's prenatal history, you had a chlamydia infection at 3 months gestational age, is that correct?\nPatient's mother: Yes, that's correct. I was treated with antibiotics for the infection.\nDoctor: Your son was born vaginally at 37 weeks gestational age, weighing 1.98 kg, and spent a total of 23 days in the NICU requiring nasogastric feeds and phototherapy. Is that accurate?\nPatient's mother: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your son was diagnosed with global developmental delay by a behavioral pediatrician and began early intervention services at 2 years of age, receiving occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Currently, he is in special education classes and is getting speech and occupational therapies. Can he understand directions and point to body parts?\nPatient's mother: Yes, he can do that.\nDoctor: In addition to these developmental delays, your son has a history of anemia, which is followed by his pediatrician. On physical exam, we found that he has a low anterior hairline, slightly downward slanting palpebral fissures, infraorbital puffiness, overfolded helices bilaterally, a broad nasal bridge, a wide grin, and a thin upper lip, which generally resembled your facial features.\nPatient's mother: Yes, I've noticed those similarities too.\nDoctor: We performed Clinical Fragile X testing on your son's DNA, and it came back normal with 29 CGG repeats.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I came to the emergency department because I've been having persistent hematochezia, lower abdominal pain, and nonbloody emesis for a month now. I've had intermittent rectal bleeding for years, but never continuously for a whole month.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any fevers, weight changes, or taken any antibiotics recently? And have you had a colonoscopy before?
Patient: No, I haven't had any fevers or weight changes, and I haven't taken antibiotics. I've never had a colonoscopy before.
Doctor: Alright. I also need to know your past medical history. Do you have any conditions that we should be aware of?
Patient: Yes, I have moderate Hemophilia A with factor activity between 1 and 5 percent. I was prescribed Recombinant human factor VIII, but I haven't been very good with my visits.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important to follow up with your prescribed treatment. Now, when your rectal bleeding increased, were you told to take your Recombinant human factor VIII at a specific dose?
Patient: Yes, I was told to take 4000 units every 12 hours on days with heavy bleeding.
Doctor: Okay. During your examination, we noted tachycardia, tenderness to palpation in your lower abdomen, and positive fecal occult blood testing. We also conducted laboratory tests, which showed your hemoglobin at 11 g/dL and PT/PTT/INR values within normal limits. Your C reactive protein was elevated at 57.8 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 21 mm/hr, and albumin at 3.5 g/dL.
Patient: Oh, wow! That sounds concerning.
Doctor: We also performed CT imaging of your abdomen and pelvis, which revealed abnormal colonic thickening. After administering Recombinant human factor VIII infusions without resolution of your symptoms, we decided to perform a colonoscopy and biopsies.
Patient: What did the biopsies show?
Doctor: The biopsies confirmed that you have chronic active ulcerative colitis. We started you on empiric therapy for inflammatory bowel disease and eventually had to give you high-dose intravenous steroids before you showed clinical improvement.
Patient: What kind of steroids and other medications did you give me?
Doctor: You were given intravenous methyl prednisolone 40 mg every six hours for the first six days, followed by 60 mg daily intravenously until your discharge. Additionally, you received budesonide 9 mg orally once daily for the first six days, mesalamine 800 mg orally three times a day for the first six days, and pantoprazole 40 mg orally for your entire 14-day inpatient stay. We also prescribed metronidazole 500 mg intravenously once daily for the first six days and then orally every eight hours until discharge.
Patient: Did you find anything else in the tests?
Doctor: Yes, your stool cultures were also taken and analyzed. It's important that we monitor your condition closely and ensure that you receive the appropriate treatment.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow up with my visits and take all the medications as prescribed.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Remember, it's important to stay on top of your treatment plan and follow up with us as needed.

Patient: Okay, I guess that sounds fine.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I presented to the emergency department because I've been experiencing extreme breathlessness and profuse diaphoresis within the last 2 hours.
Doctor: I see. Let's start with a physical examination. *After the examination* Your blood pressure is increased, and your oxygen saturation is low. I also noticed some bilateral basal pulmonary end-inspiratory rales upon auscultation of your chest.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We'll need to perform an electrocardiography (ECG) to check for any myocardial injury pattern. *After the ECG* The ECG results do not demonstrate an acute myocardial injury pattern, which is a good sign.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: We also took a chest radiography, which showed bilateral diffuse infiltrations, Kerley B lines, and flow inversion. Furthermore, we tested your cardiac serum markers (high-sensitivity troponin I using Architect STAT assay by Abbott Diagnostics) and performed a D-dimer test, both of which came back negative.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: We also conducted an echocardiographic assessment which disclosed mild concentric hypertrophy, mildly impaired left ventricular systolic function without regional wall motion abnormalities, and moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressure. Based on all this information, we have diagnosed you with acute pulmonary edema.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means fluid has built up in your lungs, making it difficult for you to breathe. We will need to hospitalize you under closed monitoring in the intensive care unit to treat this condition.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: We will administer furosemide and glyceryl trinitrate intravenously and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor orally, in combination with oxygen support. This should help subside your acute heart failure symptoms.
Patient: How long will it take for me to recover?
Doctor: Complete respiratory recovery should occur in approximately 12 hours. During the second day of hospitalization, we will perform another ECG to check for any T-wave inversion. If needed, you will also undergo coronary angiography to rule out significant coronary artery disease.
Patient: I understand.
Doctor: Keep in mind that there are other possible causes of T-wave inversion, such as myocardial ischemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, massive pulmonary embolism, pheochromocytoma, cocaine abuse, status epilepticus, gastrointestinal emergencies like perforated ulcer, acute pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis, cardiac sarcoidosis, electroconvulsive therapy, and cardiac memory T-wave pattern.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some issues with my left eye. I noticed a thickening of the iris, and it's been bothering me.
Doctor: I see. Let's perform a gonioscopy to take a closer look at the root of the iris in your left eye. 
(After performing the gonioscopy)
Doctor: The gonioscopy revealed a pigmented fusiform thickening of the iris root in your left eye. We also did an ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) which showed the presence of a well-circumscribed dome-shaped mass at the level of the ciliary body, between the 2:30 and 3 o'clock positions. The lesion is 8.18 mm large, 7.74 mm long, and 4.88 mm thick. It appears to be a melanoma of the ciliary body, involving the adjacent iris root.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What's the next step?
Doctor: In July 2008, you underwent brachytherapy using 106Ru. You received 100 Gy at the apex, with a dose rate of 79.09 cGy/hr, and a total rate at the sclera of 531.1 Gy, with a dose rate of 420.1 cGy/hr.
Patient: Okay, I remember that treatment. Did it help?
Doctor: One year later, you showed some scleral thinning and a prolapse of uveal tissue at the limbus, corresponding to the site of the preexisting lesion. UBM showed a local scleral extension of the tumor under the conjunctival layer, 0.88 mm thick. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20.
Patient: So, what was the next step?
Doctor: The patient underwent a radical block excision of the sclera, ciliary melanoma, and adjacent iris tissue. This was done by performing a peripheral iridectomy through the opening of the sclera, combined with a corneal tectonic graft, 8.50 mm large. We used 16 single stitches to close the wound.
Patient: I remember that surgery. Did it remove the melanoma completely?
Doctor: Histological analysis of the removed tissue confirmed the diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma. We will continue to monitor your condition and follow up with any necessary treatments or interventions.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having this itchy eruption on my neck and upper back for about 3 months now.
Doctor: I see. Have you identified any triggers or noticed any changes in your health during this time?
Patient: No, I haven't identified any triggers and I've been otherwise healthy.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your description and the clinical features, it seems that you, along with some other patients, have erythematous papules that form plaques arranged in a reticular pattern, which is more prominent peripherally. Other patients also had vesicles and minimal erosions, with lesions symmetrically distributed, mainly on the trunk. Have you noticed any other affected areas on your body?
Patient: Hmm, I think the lateral and posterior aspects of my neck are also affected.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for the information. A clinical diagnosis of PP was suspected in some patients with similar symptoms. We've conducted histological findings, and the differential diagnoses include impetiginized spongiotic dermatitis, pityriasis lichenoides, and viral exanthem. Periodic acid-Schiff stain was performed and came back negative for all specimens. Direct immunofluorescence was also performed for some patients and was negative as well.
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what can be done for this condition?
Doctor: The good news is that all patients eventually experienced a complete resolution of their lesions. Patient 1 was treated with superpotent topical corticosteroids prior to presentation to our department, but there was no improvement and new lesions continued to emerge. However, the patient reported gradual spontaneous resolution 10 weeks after the onset of the eruption, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Patient: What about other treatments?
Doctor: Patient 2 was previously treated with moderately potent topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, but again, there was no improvement and new lesions continued to emerge. Once doxycycline was initiated, the lesions cleared within a few weeks.
Patient: So, what do you recommend for me, doctor?
Doctor: Considering the past treatments and outcomes, I would recommend trying doxycycline to see if it helps clear the lesions. If there's no improvement, we can reassess and consider other options.
Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Please keep me updated on your progress, and if you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!","S: The patient reports a 3-month history of itchy eruptions on the neck and upper back. The eruptions are described as erythematous papules forming plaques with a reticular pattern, more prominent peripherally, and affecting the lateral and posterior aspects of the neck. The patient has not identified any triggers and reports being otherwise healthy.
O: Clinical examination reveals erythematous papules forming plaques, with some patients also presenting vesicles and minimal erosions, symmetrically distributed mainly on the trunk. Histological examination was conducted, ruling out impetiginized spongiotic dermatitis, pityriasis lichenoides, and viral exanthem through negative Periodic acid-Schiff stain and direct immunofluorescence.
A: The primary clinical diagnosis is presumed to be Pityriasis Rosea (PR), considering the pattern and nature of the eruptions and the exclusion of other differential diagnoses through histological findings. The prognosis is generally favorable as evidenced by spontaneous resolution in similar cases.
P: Initiate treatment with doxycycline, monitoring for improvement in the lesions. If there is no significant improvement, reassessment and consideration of alternative therapeutic options will be necessary.

Based on your description and the clinical features, it seems that you, along with some other patients, have erythematous papules that form plaques arranged in a reticular pattern, which is more prominent peripherally. Other patients also had vesicles and minimal erosions, with lesions symmetrically distributed, mainly on the trunk. Have you noticed any other affected areas on your body?\nPatient: Hmm, I think the lateral and posterior aspects of my neck are also affected.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for the information. A clinical diagnosis of PP was suspected in some patients with similar symptoms. We've conducted histological findings, and the differential diagnoses include impetiginized spongiotic dermatitis, pityriasis lichenoides, and viral exanthem. Periodic acid-Schiff stain was performed and came back negative for all specimens. Direct immunofluorescence was also performed for some patients and was negative as well.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what can be done for this condition?\nDoctor: The good news is that all patients eventually experienced a complete resolution of their lesions. Patient 1 was treated with superpotent topical corticosteroids prior to presentation to our department, but there was no improvement and new lesions continued to emerge. However, the patient reported gradual spontaneous resolution 10 weeks after the onset of the eruption, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.\nPatient: What about other treatments?\nDoctor: Patient 2 was previously treated with moderately potent topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, but again, there was no improvement and new lesions continued to emerge. Once doxycycline was initiated, the lesions cleared within a few weeks.\nPatient: So, what do you recommend for me, doctor?\nDoctor: Considering the past treatments and outcomes, I would recommend trying doxycycline to see if it helps clear the lesions. If there's no improvement, we can reassess and consider other options.\nPatient: Alright, I'll give it a try. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I came to the emergency department because I've been having severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past day.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: I had a pelvic exenteration and a permanent end colostomy for stage IIIb cervical cancer. About two years later, I developed a parastomal hernia.
Doctor: I see. On this admission, you were diagnosed with an incarcerated parastomal hernia. We performed an emergency laparotomy, resecting more than one-and-a-half meters of gangrenous bowel and re-fashioning the stoma. A surgical mesh was applied with primary closure. The surgery was successful, and you were transferred to the ICU for monitoring.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: About a week later, you became pyrexial and didn't respond well to treatment. CT imaging showed a five-centimeter collection over the mesh. We then opened and explored the wound in the ICU and completed debridement.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: The wound dimensions were initially 20 cm x 23 cm x 5 cm, exposing the rectus sheath. To ensure healing, we used the VeraFlo™ Vacuum with instillation dressing at -125 mmHg. We cycled a sterile saline solution for three hours before applying the vacuum.
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: We changed the dressing three times a week. Before each replacement, we soaked the dressing in saline solution for 20 minutes. After seven weeks, the wound reduced to 9 cm x 5 cm x 1.6 cm.
Patient: That's great to hear.
Doctor: Yes, there was also a significant decrease in the amount of exudate and debris, which resulted in a decreased instillation volume during that time.
Patient: Okay, good.
Doctor: I'm pleased to report that you mentioned improved pain control compared to the post-operative period. How are you feeling now?
Patient: Much better, thank you! The pain is much more manageable now.
Doctor: That's great to hear. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as needed. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

"Doctor: Hello, I have your medical history here, and it says you've had migraine headaches for over 10 years. How have you been managing them?
Patient: Yeah, that's right. I've been using analgesic treatment, and it usually helps. But the headaches get worse when I do physical exercise.
Doctor: I see. Now, I understand that you sought medical attention due to sudden and intense headaches in the occipital region with no evident cause. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. They were different from my usual migraines.
Doctor: Okay. We did an emergency computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed the presence of a right occipital intracerebral hematoma. You were hospitalized and treated for a month until the clot resolved. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I was symptom-free for about a year, but then I started having a mild to moderate oppressive headache in the right temporal region. It improved with analgesics for about 15 days.
Doctor: And what happened after that?
Patient: The oppressive headache came back, but this time it was more intense hemicrania. I also experienced fatigue, short episodes of altered consciousness, sweating, projectile vomiting, and blurred vision in my left eye.
Doctor: I see. We performed a general physical and neurological exam, which did not show any positive data. We also looked for any evidence of triggering events like traumatic brain injury, hematologic disorders, previous surgeries, or infections of the central nervous system (CNS). We couldn't find any. Have you noticed any mood changes lately?
Patient: Yeah, I've been really irritable, aggressive, and anxious. I also have trouble thinking and concentrating, and I get disoriented about time and space.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed a second CT-scan during the follow-up period. Now, let's discuss the results of your laboratory tests. Your hemoglobin is 133 g/L; leucocytes are 8.1 × 103, and platelets are 373 u/L. The coagulogram indicated suitable platelets, bleeding time of 1.30 s, coagulation time of 8 min, prothrombin time of 15.2 s (control 13 s ± 3), and activated thromboplastin time of 30 s. Your glycemia is 4.83 mmol/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is 42.51 U/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GPT) is 42.29 U/L; cholesterol is 4.24 mmol/L; triglycerides are 0.90 mmol/L; and creatinin is 82.81 μmol. 
Patient: Okay, so what does all that mean?
Doctor: The results show that your blood counts and clotting factors are within normal ranges. Your blood sugar, liver enzymes, cholesterol, and triglycerides are also normal. We will continue monitoring your condition and work on finding the best treatment plan to manage your symptoms.

They were different from my usual migraines.\nDoctor: Okay. We did an emergency computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed the presence of a right occipital intracerebral hematoma. You were hospitalized and treated for a month until the clot resolved. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I was symptom-free for about a year, but then I started having a mild to moderate oppressive headache in the right temporal region. It improved with analgesics for about 15 days.\nDoctor: And what happened after that?\nPatient: The oppressive headache came back, but this time it was more intense hemicrania. I also experienced fatigue, short episodes of altered consciousness, sweating, projectile vomiting, and blurred vision in my left eye.\nDoctor: I see. We performed a general physical and neurological exam, which did not show any positive data. We also looked for any evidence of triggering events like traumatic brain injury, hematologic disorders, previous surgeries, or infections of the central nervous system (CNS). We couldn't find any. Have you noticed any mood changes lately?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been really irritable, aggressive, and anxious. I also have trouble thinking and concentrating, and I get disoriented about time and space.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed a second CT-scan during the follow-up period. Now, let's discuss the results of your laboratory tests. Your hemoglobin is 133 g/L; leucocytes are 8.1 × 103, and platelets are 373 u/L. The coagulogram indicated suitable platelets, bleeding time of 1.30 s, coagulation time of 8 min, prothrombin time of 15.2 s (control 13 s ± 3), and activated thromboplastin time of 30 s. Your glycemia is 4.83 mmol/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is 42.51 U/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GPT) is 42.29 U/L; cholesterol is 4.24 mmol/L; triglycerides are 0.90 mmol/L; and creatinin is 82.81 μmol. \nPatient: Okay, so what does all that mean?\nDoctor: The results show that your blood counts and clotting factors are within normal ranges. Your blood sugar, liver enzymes, cholesterol, and triglycerides are also normal. We will continue monitoring your condition and work on finding the best treatment plan to manage your symptoms.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.""}

Patient: Hi, doctor. I've had this swelling on the right side of my cheek for about 6 months now. It's been getting bigger over time.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in the area?
Patient: No, not really. There hasn't been any pain at all.
Doctor: What about difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia? Have you noticed any issues with that?
Patient: No, I haven't had any trouble swallowing either.
Doctor: Alright, let's take a look. *After examining the patient* I can see a single, cystic swelling in your right cheek, around 2x2 cm2 with ill-defined margins. It's nontender and palpable bimanually. The rest of your oropharynx and laryngopharynx appear normal, and there are no palpable neck nodes. Your vitals and blood parameters are also stable.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: To better understand this swelling, we performed a cytological examination of the mass. It was reported as a chronic granulomatous lesion. We also did a CT scan of your head and neck, which revealed a well-defined cystic lesion measuring 2.6x21x19 mm3 in the right buccal space, arising from the buccinator muscle and displacing the zygomaticus major.
Patient: So what does all that mean?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we've made a provisional diagnosis of a right buccal cyst. We planned for an excision biopsy under general anesthesia and performed surgery with our team of ORL Head and Neck Surgeons.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: Intraoperatively, we found a well-defined cystic lesion measuring around 3x3 cm2 in the right buccal space. The cyst contained thick mucinous fluid. We sent the specimen for histopathological examination, and the findings were consistent with an oncocytoma.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: After the surgery, we kept you on intravenous antibiotics. The postoperative period was uneventful, with mild soft tissue swelling over the operated area without any collections. You were then discharged on the 7th postoperative day.
Patient: That's good to hear. How has my recovery been going?
Doctor: On your follow-up visit 1 week later, the swelling over the buccal region had subsided, and the intraoral surgical wound had healed. We followed up again after 3 months, and there were no signs of recurrence or disease progression.

Patient: It's been happening for the past 5 months. The pain usually comes 15-30 minutes after every meal, but it's less severe and goes away on its own.
Doctor: Okay, let's review your test results. Your full blood count, serum biochemistry values, and C-reactive protein level are within normal ranges. Your arterial gas analysis is also normal. However, your abdominal plain radiography showed free air between the liver and diaphragm, and PI (Fig.). Additionally, abdominal computed tomography showed severe calcification of the SMA origin; SMA peripheral flow was reserved (Fig.). Computed tomography (CT) revealed bubble-like intramural gas of the small bowel with the contrasted wall pneumoperitoneum (Fig.).

Patient: No, I didn't have any recurrent abdominal pain after drinking fluids.
Doctor: Great. Since there was no pain, we allowed you to eat solid food as well. Now, we had planned an angiography to further investigate and potentially relieve your postprandial abdominal pain. The findings showed severe stenosis of the SMA origin with calcification, and the SMA had replaced the common hepatic artery (Fig., ). We performed ET, namely stenting to the SMA and common hepatic artery.
Patient: How was the procedure done?
Doctor: We engaged the SMA trunk with a 6F Parent Plus 60 guiding catheter (Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) from your left brachial artery. Initially, we infused 8000 units of heparin, and added additional heparin to keep your activated whole blood clotting time over 200 seconds.
Patient: I see. So, what's next for me?
Doctor: Now that the procedure is done, we will continue to monitor your condition closely. It's essential to maintain a proper diet and follow up with your appointments regularly. If you notice any recurrence of abdominal pain or any new symptoms, please contact us immediately.

"Doctor: Hi, I understand you've been evaluated for persistent hyponatremia, which has been going on for about a month. Can you tell me about any symptoms you've experienced during this duration?
Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired and confused lately. I also noticed some unexplained weight loss.
Doctor: Your physical exam didn't show any signs of volume overload or depletion, which is good. However, your workup revealed a sodium level of 126 mmol/l without other electrolyte abnormalities, serum osmolality of 260 mOsm/kg, serum uric acid level of 2.0 mg/dl, normal cortisol, normal TSH, urine sodium of 45 mmol/l, and urine osmolality of 274 mOsm/kg. These findings are consistent with a condition called SIADH. You were taking Citalopram, which we thought might have been the cause, so we stopped it. However, your hyponatremia persisted, so we did some more tests, especially considering your extensive smoking history.
Patient: Yeah, I've been a smoker for a long time.
Doctor: We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed a right hilar mass with metastasis to the liver, right femur, and ribs. A biopsy revealed that you have small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Patient: Oh no, that's terrible.
Doctor: I understand this is difficult news, but it's important to address it. I've noticed that you've continued to smoke cigarettes even after the SCLC diagnosis. About two weeks later, you were admitted for acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to postobstructive pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and secondary pneumothorax. We managed these issues, and there was some improvement in your respiratory status.
Patient: Yeah, my breathing got a bit better after that.
Doctor: However, your PaCO2 and serum bicarbonate levels began to increase, with the bicarbonate level approaching up to 45 mEq/dl. This was associated with refractory hypokalemia and uncontrolled hypertension. We noticed metabolic alkalosis, which was chloride resistant, as your urine chloride was >20 mEq/dl. Your hyponatremia responded moderately to fluid restriction and gradually normalized after the onset of metabolic alkalosis.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: Well, with uncontrolled hypertension and the presence of chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia, we decided to conduct a workup for hyperaldosteronism. Your serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity were within normal limits, so we proceeded with a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test.
Patient: What did the test show?
Doctor: The test revealed elevations of ACTH (319 pg/ml) and cortisol (131.5 μg/dl), consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism and a condition called SAME, which is caused by an ectopic nonsuppressible source of ACTH. Furthermore, you've experienced significant weight loss of 28 pounds after your SCLC diagnosis and profound muscle wasting.
Patient: That's a lot to take in. What's next for me?
Doctor: We'll be working closely with you to create a personalized treatment plan to address both your SCLC and the metabolic issues. It's important to follow up with your medical team and monitor your symptoms. We'll do our best to support you through this process.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient reports persistent fatigue, confusion, and unexplained weight loss over the past month. He has a significant smoking history and has been previously treated with Citalopram, which was discontinued due to ongoing hyponatremia.
O: Physical examination showed no signs of volume overload or depletion. Laboratory findings indicated hyponatremia with a sodium level of 126 mmol/l, serum osmolality of 260 mOsm/kg, serum uric acid of 2.0 mg/dl, normal cortisol and TSH levels, urine sodium of 45 mmol/l, and urine osmolality of 274 mOsm/kg.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you were referred to us for management of fetal demise. Can you tell me about your antenatal visits and any symptoms you've experienced during your pregnancy?
Patient: Yes, I attended 3 antenatal visits at a health center. They documented my fundal height at each visit and gave me routine care. I had occasional painful fetal kicks, but I was otherwise well throughout the antenatal period.
Doctor: It's good that you had regular visits. When did you start to notice reduced fetal movements?
Patient: Hmm, about three days before I got admitted to your service, I noticed the reduced movements, so I consulted at the health center, and they said it was fetal demise.
Doctor: I see. When you were admitted to our unit, we checked your vital parameters and found them to be stable. There was no abdominal tenderness, and your fundal height was 32cm. Fetal parts were not easily palpable, and we couldn't perceive fetal heart tones. Also, there were no signs of per vaginal bleeding. Your cervix was long, posterior, firm, and closed. We requested an emergency ultrasound scan, which confirmed the fetal demise and showed gross cranial deformation. However, it didn't diagnose an intra-abdominal location.
Patient: That's really sad. So, what did you do next?
Doctor: We started cervical ripening with 50µg of misoprostol vaginally every 6 hours. After 4 applications, your cervix remained unchanged. So, we decided to proceed with operative delivery to avoid failed induction and reduce the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Patient: What did you find during the operation?
Doctor: The intraoperative findings showed a third-degree macerated female fetus floating freely in the peritoneal cavity, weighing 2650g with a tight cord round her neck, and there was no amniotic sac. The uterus was about 14 weeks, and the fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. The placenta was implanted on the ascending colon and mesocolon. We decided to leave the placenta in place as there were no intraoperative complications encountered.
Patient: What treatment did I receive after the operation?
Doctor: Postoperatively, you were placed on ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole parenterally for five days to prevent infection. Additionally, you received 50mg of methotrexate every other day for 4 doses, along with 5mg of folinic acid each day following the methotrexate treatment.
Patient: When can I expect to be discharged?
Doctor: You were discharged on day 8 postoperation to continue your recovery at home.
Patient: Thank you for all the information and the care I received during this difficult time.
Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to support you. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Patient: Hmm, well, I've had some issues with intravenous drug abuse and I've been incarcerated before.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Let's take a look at your wrist. I'll need to remove the splint and take new X-rays to assess the situation.
Patient: Sure, go ahead.
[Doctor takes X-rays]
Doctor: Your X-rays show that the fracture is highly comminuted, meaning there are many small, intra-articular fragments. To restore overall radiographic parameters and stability, we'll use ligamentotaxis with a 2.4/2.7 mm Synthes dorsal bridge plate. We'll also add percutaneously placed K wires for extra stabilization of the radial styloid and lunate facet.
Patient: Okay, so what does that involve?
Doctor: We'll make two incisions, one over the index metacarpal and one over the radial shaft. We won't open the third dorsal extensor compartment at the level of the wrist, which is a contrast to others' techniques. The plate will be placed deep to the extensor tendons in the proximal, radial shaft incision. We'll leave the K wire ends outside the skin to allow staged hardware removal without multiple trips to the operating room.
Patient: Got it. And after the procedure, what will my recovery look like?
Doctor: Postoperative X-rays will show improved radial inclination and articular congruity, with some residual slight dorsal tilt. You'll return for regular follow-up visits, and we'll remove the two K wires in the clinic about 4 weeks after surgery. At that point, you should be able to extend your thumb at the interphalangeal joint.
Patient: That sounds good. Is there anything else I should know?
Doctor: Plate removal will be discussed during your follow-up visits, but it's important to keep attending those appointments. In some cases, patients might experience sensations like clicking with wrist motion or difficulty extending their thumb. If that happens, we'll need to address it.
Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to come to my follow-up visits. Thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns during your recovery, or if you experience any new trauma to your wrist or hand, please don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient, a history of intravenous drug abuse and incarceration, presents nine days post-fall from a bunk bed with a chief complaint of pain in the left wrist.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been hospitalized for persistent aching pain in your abdomen and lower extremities for nearly 20 days. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, it's been really bothering me for the past 20 days, and I've also had severe hair loss for the past 10 days.
Doctor: I see. Let me ask you a few questions to better understand your situation. Have you had any significant health issues in the past?
Patient: No, I've been healthy and I haven't taken any medications.
Doctor: Alright. And is there any chance you might have been accidentally poisoned?
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Okay, let's proceed with a physical examination. Hmm, I see that you have diffuse alopecia of the scalp. I also noticed that your liver function is damaged, with ALT at 154.8u/l and AST at 49.2 u/l. We've tested your urine mercury, hair arsenic, and blood lead levels, and they're all normal. 
Patient: Oh no, what could be causing this?
Doctor: We continued to monitor your condition, and your scalp hair was completely lost within a week. After further investigation, we've determined that you have thallium poisoning. This was confirmed by the elevated levels of thallium ion in your urine, which was 4677.0μg/l, and in your blood, which was 312.1μg/l. The normal range for urine is 5μg/l, and for blood, it's 0μg/l.
Patient: That's shocking! What can be done to treat this?
Doctor: We have started you on ten cycles of hemoperfusion and hemodialysis, each lasting for 5 to 6 hours daily. As these treatments were conducted, your blood and urine thallium levels have decreased.
Patient: That's a relief. Is there anything else being done for my treatment?
Doctor: Yes, after the hemoperfusion and hemodialysis, we've seen improvement in your neurological manifestations and liver function parameters. We've also given you Prussian blue 2.64 g, Q6h, forced diuresis, and 20 mmol potassium chloride twice a day, along with intravenous B complex.
Patient: How long will it take for my pain to subside and my hair to grow back?
Doctor: Your pain should disappear slowly, and your hair regrowth started 10 days later. It should be complete during your 6-month follow-up.
Patient: I hope so. Do we know what caused the poisoning?
Doctor: Unfortunately, the reason for the poisoning remains unknown despite an investigation conducted by police authorities.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented to our department due to a worsening of cognitive functions that have been observed for 2-3 years. Can you tell me more about how this has affected you in the past few days?
Patient: Yeah, it's gotten worse over the past three days. I can't do some simple tasks in everyday life and I've lost interest in the things I used to enjoy.
Doctor: I understand. Are you still able to do things like going to the supermarket and doing housework unsupervised?
Patient: Yes, I can still do those things independently.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I've also reviewed your medical history, and I see that you have dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, and you had a stroke at the age of 36 with mild right hemiparesis. Have you experienced any episodes of aphasia that could be considered as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)?
Patient: Yes, I've had several episodes of aphasia.
Doctor: I also noticed that you have a history of smoking. Regarding your family, are there any hereditary diseases or health problems identified among your parents, siblings, or offspring?
Patient: No, my family doesn't have any hereditary diseases or health problems.
Doctor: I see. During your neurological examination, we observed mild bilateral dysmetria. Our mental examination also revealed executive dysfunction and pronounced cognitive slowing. Your Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 25, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) score was 5, phonemic fluency was 4 in one minute, and semantic fluency was 3 in one minute. 
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound too good.
Doctor: It's not ideal, but we will work on finding the best treatment plan for you. Your laboratory blood tests revealed significant dyslipidaemia, with a total cholesterol level of 7.55 mmol/L and a low-density lipoprotein level of 5.82 mmol/L. Your cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable.
Patient: What about any issues with my arteries?
Doctor: We detected low-grade bilateral internal and external carotid artery stenosis on your carotid ultrasound.
Patient: And what about my brain? Did the imaging show anything?
Doctor: Yes, the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed communicating hydrocephalus, which is most likely due to brain atrophy and secondary brain changes. There was no obvious cause of obstruction in the ventricles. Your Huckman index was equal to 66, and the width of the third ventricle was equal to 10 mm. We also found extensive leukoencephalopathy with a Fazekas scale score of 2-3, and lacunar lesions in the dorsal part of the pons, thalamus bilaterally, and right cerebellar hemisphere.
Patient: That sounds concerning. What do we do next?
Doctor: We will develop a treatment plan to address your cognitive decline and work on managing your dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team regularly, and we will monitor your progress closely.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient reports a worsening of cognitive functions over the past 2-3 years, which has recently intensified over the past three days, affecting daily tasks and interest in usual activities. The patient can still perform some daily activities independently, such as going to the supermarket and doing housework. The patient has a history of dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, stroke with mild right hemiparesis, and episodes of aphasia suggestive of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).

Differential diagnoses include vascular dementia and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, considering the patient's age and cognitive symptoms. The presence of hydrocephalus, extensive leukoencephalopathy, and lacunar lesions further complicates the clinical picture, suggesting multi-factorial etiologies for cognitive impairment.
P: The management plan will focus on addressing cognitive decline, controlling dyslipidemia, and managing arterial hypertension. Specific interventions include:
- Initiation of statin therapy for dyslipidemia.
- Optimization of antihypertensive therapy.
- Regular monitoring of cognitive function and adjustment of treatments as necessary.
- Referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and management of cognitive issues and potential hydrocephalus.
- Patient education on lifestyle modifications to reduce vascular risk factors, including smoking cessation.

Can you tell me more about how this has affected you in the past few days?\nPatient: Yeah, it's gotten worse over the past three days. I can't do some simple tasks in everyday life and I've lost interest in the things I used to enjoy.\nDoctor: I understand. Are you still able to do things like going to the supermarket and doing housework unsupervised?\nPatient: Yes, I can still do those things independently.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. I've also reviewed your medical history, and I see that you have dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, and you had a stroke at the age of 36 with mild right hemiparesis. Have you experienced any episodes of aphasia that could be considered as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)?\nPatient: Yes, I've had several episodes of aphasia.\nDoctor: I also noticed that you have a history of smoking. Regarding your family, are there any hereditary diseases or health problems identified among your parents, siblings, or offspring?\nPatient: No, my family doesn't have any hereditary diseases or health problems.\nDoctor: I see. During your neurological examination, we observed mild bilateral dysmetria. Our mental examination also revealed executive dysfunction and pronounced cognitive slowing. Your Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 25, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) score was 5, phonemic fluency was 4 in one minute, and semantic fluency was 3 in one minute. \nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound too good.\nDoctor: It's not ideal, but we will work on finding the best treatment plan for you. Your laboratory blood tests revealed significant dyslipidaemia, with a total cholesterol level of 7.55 mmol/L and a low-density lipoprotein level of 5.82 mmol/L. Your cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable.\nPatient: What about any issues with my arteries?\nDoctor: We detected low-grade bilateral internal and external carotid artery stenosis on your carotid ultrasound.\nPatient: And what about my brain? Did the imaging show anything?\nDoctor: Yes, the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed communicating hydrocephalus, which is most likely due to brain atrophy and secondary brain changes. There was no obvious cause of obstruction in the ventricles. Your Huckman index was equal to 66, and the width of the third ventricle was equal to 10 mm. We also found extensive leukoencephalopathy with a Fazekas scale score of 2-3, and lacunar lesions in the dorsal part of the pons, thalamus bilaterally, and right cerebellar hemisphere.\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What do we do next?\nDoctor: We will develop a treatment plan to address your cognitive decline and work on managing your dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team regularly, and we will monitor your progress closely.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I was informed that you are a primigravid 24-year-old female who was referred to the emergency department from the community health center. Can you tell me what happened?
Patient: Yes, I just gave birth 1.5 hours ago with the help of a midwife. After the baby was born, they tried to remove the placenta by performing placental traction. Suddenly, a large mass emerged through my vaginal passage along with the placenta. I started bleeding heavily and lost consciousness.
Doctor: I see. When you arrived at the emergency department, you were anemic and unresponsive with active vaginal bleeding. Our physical examination revealed hypotension with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg, tachycardia at 138 beats/min, and tachypnea at 26 breaths/min. Your conjunctiva was anemic, and you had perioral cyanosis, cold & mottled extremities, and prolonged capillary refill time of more than 3 seconds. We also found that you had a total uterine inversion and perineal lacerations.
Patient: Oh, that sounds terrible. What did you do to help me?
Doctor: We immediately performed bloodwork upon your admission, which showed anemia with haemoglobin at 5.9 g/dL, hematocrit at 17.4%, and erythrocyte count at 2.07 million/uL. You also had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22,000/uL, but your thrombocyte level was normal at 358,000/uL.
Patient: So what was the treatment?
Doctor: We treated you with fluid resuscitation using both colloids and crystalloids, along with blood transfusion and uterotonics. We successfully performed a manual reposition of your uterus and applied internal bimanual compression for 15 minutes. However, you still had profuse hemorrhage due to uterine atony.
Patient: How did you manage that?
Doctor: We placed a balloon tamponade to stop the hemorrhage and reduce the risk of recurrence. Thankfully, your condition stabilized, and we didn't need to perform surgical management or a hysterectomy. We then repaired your perineal lacerations once the bleeding was under control.
Patient: I'm glad to hear that. How am I doing now?
Doctor: After transfusing 4 packed red cells, we repeated your bloodwork. Your hemoglobin is now at 10 g/dL, hematocrit at 29%, erythrocyte count at 3.66 million/uL, leucocyte count at 20,900/uL, and thrombocyte count at 159,000/uL. You have shown significant improvement.
Patient: That's a relief. What's next for me?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely.

"Doctor: Hello, I am Dr. Johnson, and I will be taking care of you today. I understand that you were brought to the emergency department of our tertiary care referral hospital with a history of accidentally consuming car coolant and experiencing unsteadiness in your gait about 3 hours later. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I accidentally drank some car coolant and started feeling unsteady on my feet after about 3 hours.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. On examination, we observed that you were drowsy but following verbal commands. There was no odor of alcohol in your breath. Your GCS score was 15/15 (E4V5M6). Your blood pressure was 140/80 mm of Hg, and your pulse rate was 68 per minute. Oxygen saturation was maintained at room air. We also performed an ECG, which was normal, and no focal neurological deficit was detected. As a first line of treatment, we performed gastric lavage. We also conducted some laboratory investigations. 
Patient: Okay, doctor. What were the results of those investigations?
Doctor: Your lab results showed the following: Na+ was 142 mEq/L, K+ 2.4 mEq/L, Cl− 101.1 mEq/L, HCO3− 15.8 mEq/L, Ca+ 5 mg/dl, urea 35 mg/dl, creatinine 0.7 mg/dl, BUN 16.35 mg/dl, random glucose 141 mg/dl, and serum osmolality 323 mOsm/kg. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.322, pCO2 30.7 mmHg, pO2 93.8 mmHg, cBase(B)c −9.1. 
Patient: Oh, I see. What does all that mean?
Doctor: Also, your urine examination revealed crystals of calcium oxalate, which is a major indicator of ethylene glycol consumption. Your anion gap was 25.1 mEq/L, and the osmolar gap was 17 mOsm/kg·H2O. Unfortunately, we could not obtain blood and urine levels of ethylene glycol due to the lack of such analytical facilities in the region.
Patient: So, what's the plan for my treatment, doctor?
Doctor: Based on your lab results, we have confirmed a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. We have started you on oral ethanol therapy, which involves administering 2.5 ml/kg of 40% ethanol through a nasogastric tube. Additionally, due to the high anion gap metabolic acidosis, we will be giving you hemodialysis as part of your treatment.
Patient: Alright, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions or share any concerns you may have.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a male, presented to the emergency department after accidentally ingesting car coolant, reporting unsteadiness in his gait approximately 3 hours post-ingestion. He described feeling drowsy but was able to follow verbal commands.
O: Physical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15/15, blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg, pulse rate of 68 beats per minute, and normal oxygen saturation on room air. An ECG showed no abnormalities, and no focal neurological deficits were observed. Laboratory findings indicated hypokalemia (K+ 2.4 mEq/L), hypocalcemia (Ca+ 5 mg/dl), metabolic acidosis (HCO3− 15.8 mEq/L, pH 7.322), and high anion gap metabolic acidosis (anion gap 25.1 mEq/L). Urine examination revealed calcium oxalate crystals. Gastric lavage was performed as an initial treatment.
A: The primary diagnosis is ethylene glycol poisoning, evidenced by the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in urine, metabolic acidosis, and an elevated anion gap. The differential diagnosis would consider other causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, but clinical presentation and lab results strongly point to ethylene glycol toxicity.
P: The patient has been started on oral ethanol therapy, dosed at 2.5 ml/kg of 40% ethanol via a nasogastric tube, to competitively inhibit the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Hemodialysis is also initiated to correct metabolic acidosis and remove ethylene glycol from the bloodstream.

Patient: Yes, actually. I developed a different headache that got worse when I was upright.
Doctor: I understand. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe would you rate this new headache?
Patient: I'd say it was an 8 out of 10. It was really bad, and I also had nausea and vomiting.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems your headache was persistent for 4 days and didn't improve with steroids, caffeine infusion, or hydrocodone-acetaminophen treatment. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement to further assess your condition. The results showed cerebellar tonsils descending through the foramen magnum, slit ventricles, and enhancement of the dura. 
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: It's a significant finding, but we proceeded with an epidural injection of whole blood to address your symptoms. How did you feel after the procedure?

Can you describe these headaches to me?\nPatient: Yeah, they're really diffuse and have been bothering me for a while now.\nDoctor: I see. We performed a fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture to help evaluate your condition. The initial pressure was 5 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 11.5 cm of H2O by fluid column method. We removed a total of 10 cc of clear CSF. The final pressure was 2 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 3.5 cm of H2O by fluid column method. After the puncture, did you experience any changes in your headache?\nPatient: Yes, actually. I developed a different headache that got worse when I was upright.\nDoctor: I understand. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe would you rate this new headache?\nPatient: I'd say it was an 8 out of 10. It was really bad, and I also had nausea and vomiting.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems your headache was persistent for 4 days and didn't improve with steroids, caffeine infusion, or hydrocodone-acetaminophen treatment. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement to further assess your condition. The results showed cerebellar tonsils descending through the foramen magnum, slit ventricles, and enhancement of the dura. \nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: It's a significant finding, but we proceeded with an epidural injection of whole blood to address your symptoms. How did you feel after the procedure?\nPatient: I felt much better! The headaches completely went away, and I'd rate them as 0 out of 10 now.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. Were you able to ambulate without any difficulty after the treatment?\nPatient: Yes, I didn't have any trouble walking around.\nDoctor: That's excellent. It appears that the epidural injection was effective in resolving your headaches. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and contact us if you experience any changes or concerns.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come in for an outpatient consultation regarding painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this pain?
Patient: Yeah, I've been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. It's been pretty bad.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your pain?
Patient: I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10.
Doctor: Have you found anything that helps relieve the pain?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they seem to help.
Doctor: Good to know. Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?
Patient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.
Doctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?
Patient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?
Doctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.
Patient: What can be done about it?
Doctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.
Patient: What should I expect during the surgery?
Doctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio® to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.
Patient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I feel more comfortable knowing what to expect.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to make the procedure as smooth and successful as possible. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient reports experiencing painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy for approximately 18 months, rating the pain as 7-8 out of 10. The pain is partially relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient denies muscle contracture and pain upon palpation.

Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been diagnosed with MCC and I'm not sure about my Merkel cell polyomavirus status. It's been tough lately.
Doctor: I understand. Your records show that you have histologically-proven MCC metastatic to the liver. We started you on first-line therapy with pembrolizumab for 2 months, but unfortunately, you had progressive disease (PD) as your best response. (Fig.)
Patient: Yeah, that's right. I was then treated with something else, I think it was ipilimumab and nivolumab.
Doctor: Yes, you were treated with four cycles of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4, 3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1, 1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks × 4. You experienced a partial response per immune-related response criteria, which lasted 30 weeks before your disease progressed again.
Patient: I remember that. But those medications were given to me again, right?
Doctor: Correct. Ipilimumab and nivolumab were administered again, but they resulted in PD at 14 weeks. After that, we decided to try a different approach.
Patient: That's when I started receiving avelumab and radiotherapy, right?
Doctor: Yes, you were given avelumab (anti-PD-L1) 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 3D conformal radiation therapy, 2500 centigray, to a right iliac mass. This treatment resulted in a partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1.
Patient: I remember feeling better after that.
Doctor: Indeed, there was marked regression in the irradiated tumor (Fig.), and your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status improved from 2 to 0. Your partial response lasted 12 months.
Patient: That's great to hear. So, what's next for me, Doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. It's important to maintain regular check-ups and follow our recommendations. We're here to support you every step of the way.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to Queens Hospital Center with a complaint of shortness of breath for two days duration. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?
Patient: Yeah, I've been noticing a decrease in my exercise tolerance for a few weeks now. And two weeks ago, I was admitted here for chest pain, but they ruled out acute coronary syndrome.
Doctor: I see. Based on your evaluation, you had tachycardia with a heart rate of 120-124/min and blood pressure of 110/80 mm Hg. Your lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of infection or blood loss. We started you on anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism. Do you remember if you had a CT chest done?
Patient: No, they didn't do a CT chest initially because my creatinine was elevated at 1.6.
Doctor: Right, so instead they did a ventilation/perfusion scan, or V/Q scan, which showed intermediate probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. We decided to continue your anticoagulation. However, you still had persistent tachycardia, and blood tests showed hypocalcemia at 6.8-7.9 mg/dL and hypokalemia at 3.2-3.4 mEQ/L, but your thyroid function was normal.
Patient: Oh, I didn't know that.
Doctor: We also found that your 25-hydroxyvitamin D test was low at 6 ng/ml, and your intact parathyroid hormone was elevated at 85.1 pg/ml. As a result, we put you on metoprolol 50 mg twice daily and continued intravenous hydration with electrolyte supplementation. We eventually did a CT chest which confirmed the presence of old embolism and showed a 1.1 cm nodule in your left upper lobe.
Patient: So, what's the plan now?
Doctor: We've consulted endocrinology for your persistent tachycardia with relatively stable blood pressure. You also had spikes of temperature for two days, so we started you on Tamiflu and Rocephin while waiting for blood culture results.
Patient: Okay, I understand. But I really want to be discharged and go home.
Doctor: I understand, but we need to monitor your condition closely. Unfortunately, you suddenly collapsed and went into cardiorespiratory failure. We had to intubate you and transfer you to the intensive care unit for further management.
Patient's Family: What happened after that?
Doctor: We attempted to resuscitate him in the ICU, but sadly, our efforts were futile. I'm very sorry for your loss.
Patient's Family: Thank you for trying. We don't want an autopsy to be performed.
Doctor: We understand and respect your decision. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.","S: The patient, a male admitted to Queens Hospital Center, complained of shortness of breath persisting for two days and decreased exercise tolerance over a few weeks. He had a history of chest pain two weeks prior, which was evaluated but did not result in a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The patient was unaware of some of his lab results and treatment details until explained by the physician.
O: Upon evaluation, the patient exhibited tachycardia with a heart rate of 120-124/min and blood pressure of 110/80 mm Hg. Lungs were clear on auscultation, and there was no sign of infection or blood loss. Initial tests showed elevated creatinine at 1.6, preventing a CT chest, leading to a V/Q scan indicating intermediate probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. Lab results also indicated hypocalcemia (6.8-7.9 mg/dL), hypokalemia (3.2-3.4 mEQ/L), low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (6 ng/ml), and elevated intact parathyroid hormone (85.1 pg/ml). A subsequent CT chest confirmed old embolism and revealed a 1.1 cm nodule in the left upper lobe. The patient experienced persistent tachycardia, temperature spikes, and ultimately cardiorespiratory failure, leading to intubation and ICU transfer.
A: The primary diagnosis was pulmonary embolism with complications including electrolyte imbalances (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia) and vitamin D deficiency. Differential diagnosis included secondary hyperparathyroidism. The patient's sudden collapse and cardiorespiratory failure were critical developments, leading to his death despite resuscitative efforts.
P: The patient was managed with anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism and metoprolol 50 mg twice daily for tachycardia. Intravenous hydration with electrolyte supplementation was administered to address imbalances. Endocrinology was consulted for the management of persistent tachycardia and potential parathyroid issues.

Patient: Yes, the pain gets worse after eating, and I also experience abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus.
Doctor: Have you tried any treatments for these symptoms before coming here?
Patient: I was taking some traditional Chinese medicine that temporarily relieved the symptoms.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any medical history we should know about?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension, but my control has been poor.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It looks like you underwent a colonoscopy examination in a local hospital. What were the results of that examination?
Patient: They verbally reported no pathologic findings.
Doctor: Alright, during your physical examination here, we found mesogastric tenderness and an enlarged spleen. Your blood laboratory examination reported only mild hypokalemia, and your urinary and stool reports were normal. Enhanced computerized tomography showed splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis. These signs are compatible with hepatic schistosomiasis.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a condition that needs attention. During the double balloon enteroscopy, we noticed that your blood pressure was not stable, so we couldn't reexamine the colon. The upper enteroscopy showed an ulcer 150 cm distal to the Treitz ligament, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The ulcer had a white coating and peripheral mucosal hyperemia, occupying 2/3 of the lumen, making it difficult for the endoscope to pass through. We took four biopsies from the ulcer, and 20 cm proximal from the ulcer, we found many scattered irregular ulcers, from which we took two biopsies.

Doctor: The examination reported chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old S. japonicum eggs deposition.
Patient: What treatment did I receive during my hospitalization?
Doctor: You received symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors.
Patient: I remember now. Unfortunately, I had to request a voluntary discharge from the hospital and decided to continue my treatment and follow-up at a local hospital.

A: The primary diagnosis is chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old S. japonicum eggs deposition. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of abdominal pain and weight loss.
P: The management plan includes symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors. The patient was discharged from the hospital with instructions to continue treatment and follow-up at a local hospital. "
"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been referred to our hospital due to a mass that was incidentally discovered in your right kidney. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: The mass is 16-mm in size and located in the anterior medial position of your kidney. We performed a renal biopsy, which confirmed that it's renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer.
Patient: Oh no, that's terrible.
Doctor: I understand your concern. We have a treatment plan to address this issue. We placed a hook wire in the tumor with the help of an interventional radiologist and CT guidance.
Patient: What's the purpose of that?
Doctor: The hook wire helps us localize the tumor during surgery. It's a technique we use for nonpalpable breast lesions to facilitate intraoperative localization. We will perform a partial nephrectomy to remove the tumor.
Patient: How does the surgery work?
Doctor: You will be placed in a modified left lateral decubitus position, and we will establish pneumoperitoneum. Trocars will be placed to access your abdomen. We will mobilize your bowel medially and develop the plane between the anterior Gerota's fascia and the posterior mesocolon.
Patient: Okay, and then?
Doctor: Your kidney will be mobilized within Gerota's fascia. We will locate the hook wire and clamp the renal artery with a bulldog. The renal capsule will be resected using scissors under warm ischemia, which will take about 25 minutes.
Patient: How will you stop the bleeding?
Doctor: Hemostasis will be achieved using a combination of cautery, hemostatic agents, and suturing. We will use sutures preloaded with clips to secure a suture line, allowing for lateral compression perpendicular to the renal capsule.
Patient: What will the results be like?
Doctor: The histopathology report confirmed clear-cell renal carcinoma with negative surgical margins. According to the TNM 2017 classification, it's stage pT1a.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that the cancer is in its early stage and we were able to remove it completely.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been suffering from HCC with multiple lung metastases for the past 3 months. You're a hepatitis B carrier, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: I see that you were admitted complaining of a headache. We performed a brain MRI scan to check for any brain metastasis. The results showed a solid mass occupying your left nasal cavity, measuring 3.7 × 1.8 × 2.8 cm.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Yes, the mass showed iso-signal intensity on the T1 weighted image, high signal intensity on the T2 weighted image, and heterogeneous well enhancement on the Gd-T1 weighted image. Gradient-echo images also showed small foci of low signal, suggesting haemorrhage in the mass.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: This means that there might be bleeding within the mass. We didn't find any restricted diffusion in the mass on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Metastasis of HCC was suggested, as your nasal cavity was normal on a positron emission tomography CT scan that had been performed 3 months ago.
Patient: I see. I have developed some symptoms like left nasal obstruction, clear rhinorrhea, and left facial pain.
Doctor: Those symptoms are consistent with the mass in your nasal cavity. We performed an excisional biopsy with a CT scan 17 days after the MRI scan. It showed that the mass had rapidly increased in size to 6.2 × 2.2 × 3.4 cm, with involvement of the ostium of the nasolacrimal duct and the lateral wall of the anterior nasal cavity.
Patient: Wow, that's a big change.
Doctor: Yes, it is. There was no calcification in the mass on the pre-contrast CT scan. We conducted a punch biopsy and the histological examination revealed tumor cells with enlarged nucleoli and clear cytoplasm arranged in trabecular cords and glandular arrays, consistent with metastatic HCC.
Patient: So, what's the grade of the tumor?
Doctor: The tumor is grade 2, which means it's moderately differentiated. We were planning for a resection of the tumor, but unfortunately, your general condition has declined.
Patient: Oh no, what's going to happen now?

You're a hepatitis B carrier, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I see that you were admitted complaining of a headache. We performed a brain MRI scan to check for any brain metastasis. The results showed a solid mass occupying your left nasal cavity, measuring 3.7 × 1.8 × 2.8 cm.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Yes, the mass showed iso-signal intensity on the T1 weighted image, high signal intensity on the T2 weighted image, and heterogeneous well enhancement on the Gd-T1 weighted image. Gradient-echo images also showed small foci of low signal, suggesting haemorrhage in the mass.\nPatient: Hmm, what does that mean?\nDoctor: This means that there might be bleeding within the mass. We didn't find any restricted diffusion in the mass on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Metastasis of HCC was suggested, as your nasal cavity was normal on a positron emission tomography CT scan that had been performed 3 months ago.\nPatient: I see. I have developed some symptoms like left nasal obstruction, clear rhinorrhea, and left facial pain.\nDoctor: Those symptoms are consistent with the mass in your nasal cavity. We performed an excisional biopsy with a CT scan 17 days after the MRI scan. It showed that the mass had rapidly increased in size to 6.2 × 2.2 × 3.4 cm, with involvement of the ostium of the nasolacrimal duct and the lateral wall of the anterior nasal cavity.\nPatient: Wow, that's a big change.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. There was no calcification in the mass on the pre-contrast CT scan. We conducted a punch biopsy and the histological examination revealed tumor cells with enlarged nucleoli and clear cytoplasm arranged in trabecular cords and glandular arrays, consistent with metastatic HCC.\nPatient: So, what's the grade of the tumor?\nDoctor: The tumor is grade 2, which means it's moderately differentiated. We were planning for a resection of the tumor, but unfortunately, your general condition has declined.\nPatient: Oh no, what's going to happen now?\nDoctor: Due to your location and your current condition, we're going to transfer you to another hospital for further treatment and care.\nPatient: I understand. Thank you for the information and your help, doctor.""}

"Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith, the specialist you were referred to by your primary care physician. Can you tell me about the problem you've been experiencing?
Patient: Hello, Dr. Smith. My primary care doctor noticed that my tonsils were enlarged during an examination of my oral cavity. The right one is slightly larger than the left, but there wasn't any surface abnormality.
Doctor: I see. And did your doctor prescribe any medication for it?
Patient: Yes, they prescribed me two courses of amoxicillin, but it didn't help me improve.
Doctor: Alright. I've reviewed your medical history and it seems to be unremarkable. We also did not find any cervical lymphadenopathy, significant systemic symptoms, malignancy, or immunocompromise. Your laboratory parameters were within normal limits as well.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: We conducted a Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging test to look for any mass lesions in your tonsils, but no obvious mass was found. However, the images did show that the right tonsil is larger than the left.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: On the axial T2-weighted image and postgadolinium T1-weighted image with fat saturation, we did not find any mass in the right tonsil. The left tonsil showed mucosal crypts with linear enhancement, but on the right side, the crypts were partly obliterated by a large mass and did not display enhancement.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Due to the possibility of malignancy, we decided to perform a complete surgical resection of the right tonsil.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The surgery was successful. The histological examination of the specimen revealed diffuse sheets of monomorphous plasmacytoid cells with abundant eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. We also observed occasional binucleated and pleomorphic cells with giant nuclei and prominent nucleoli, as well as mitotic figures.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: These findings indicate that there is no amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemically, the plasma cells were diffusely immunoreactive for λ light chain and IgG. This means that the cells are producing a specific type of antibody, but it's not a sign of malignancy.
Patient: Oh, that's a relief.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Now that the surgery is complete, we will continue to monitor your recovery and ensure that there are no further issues. Please follow the post-surgery care instructions and contact us if you have any concerns.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. You were admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology service for a planned transvaginal hysterectomy. Can you tell me more about your medical history and any current symptoms you're experiencing?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.
Doctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.
Patient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my α-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl.
Doctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.
Patient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?
Doctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.
Patient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.
Doctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.
Patient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?
Doctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation. When you tried to ambulate further, you developed perioral cyanosis.
Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What should I do now, Doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and provide necessary medical support. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We will work together to ensure your recovery and to manage your various health conditions.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.","S: The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a complex medical history including rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. She denies significant alcohol use and has negative viral hepatitis serologies. She reports shortness of breath postoperatively.
O: The patient's ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were negative, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and α-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl. Her BMI is 29.83. Preoperative resting supine oxygen saturation was 93%. Postoperatively, she experienced a drop in hemoglobin by two grams, corrected with two units of packed red blood cells. Despite this, she developed hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation, and perioral cyanosis on further ambulation.
A: Primary diagnosis is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, potentially exacerbated by long-term methotrexate use. Postoperative complications include significant hypoxemia and potential anemia. Differential diagnoses for her respiratory symptoms could include pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or pneumonia.
P: Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and hemoglobin levels. Consider further diagnostic workup for postoperative respiratory distress, including chest X-ray and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism. Ensure adequate oxygenation and consider respiratory support if hypoxemia persists. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms. Manage underlying chronic conditions with appropriate medications and lifestyle modifications. Follow up with rheumatology for methotrexate evaluation and gastroenterology for liver disease management.",Create a medical SOAP summary of this dialogue.,"[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert medical professor assisting in the creation of medically accurate SOAP summaries.

I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.\nDoctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my α-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl.\nDoctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.\nPatient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?\nDoctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.\nPatient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.\nDoctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.\nPatient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation. When you tried to ambulate further, you developed perioral cyanosis.\nPatient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What should I do now, Doctor?\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and provide necessary medical support. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We will work together to ensure your recovery and to manage your various health conditions.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you were referred to our Veterinary Teaching Hospital at CEU Cardenal Herrera University because your French bulldog has a corneal mass on the right eye that has been enlarging over a 2-month period. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. He's a 7-year-old male and had a complete excision of the third eyelid gland 5 years ago.
Doctor: I see. And did he develop any complications after that surgery?
Patient: Yes, he developed keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which we've been controlling with cyclosporine eye drops and artificial tears.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's proceed with the examination. I noticed an exophytic pink to white gelatinous mass occupying about 70% of the central cornea on his right eye (Fig. a). His dazzle reflex seems inconsistent, and his menace response is negative. I'll perform a fluorescein staining to check for any corneal damage.
Patient: Alright, what did you find?
Doctor: The fluorescein staining was negative. I also conducted a slit lamp biomicroscopy examination, which showed a severe increase in corneal thickness, pigment deposit, and superficial vascularization. The mass seems to be infiltrating the corneal stroma.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed a Schirmer tear test-1 and measured the intraocular pressure by applanation tonometry. Both of these tests were within normal limits. However, we couldn't perform an indirect ophthalmoscopy.
Patient: And what about his left eye?
Doctor: The ophthalmic exam of the left eye was unremarkable, and no abnormalities were observed on the physical examination.
Patient: So, what's the diagnosis for his right eye?
Doctor: At this time, we suspect it may be corneal neoplasia. Other differential diagnoses include granulation tissue and a chronic inflammatory process. To confirm the diagnosis, we performed an excisional superficial keratectomy under general anesthesia.
Patient: What did you find from that procedure?
Doctor: The histological findings were consistent with corneal carcinoma. We proceeded with transconjunctival enucleation to remove the mass.
Patient: And what happens after that?
Doctor: We have fixed the globe, conjunctiva, and nictitant membrane in 10% neutral buffered formalin and submitted it for histopathologic examination. We'll be able to provide more information once we have the results.

"Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you have osteoarthritis and hypothyroidism. What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, doc. I noticed a rapidly growing lesion near my left eye about 3 weeks ago, and it's been growing ever since. My primary care physician referred me to you.
Doctor: I see. Let's take a look at the lesion. Upon examination, it appears to be a medial orbital mass causing ectropion of the lower eyelid and symptomatic epiphora. We should perform a CT scan of the orbits to further investigate this lesion.
Patient: Alright, doc. What did the CT scan results show?
Doctor: The CT scan showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.0 cm nonenhancing intraorbital soft tissue lesion abutting the nasal lacrimal duct, lateral and inferior to the globe, without definite osseous remodeling. There is no thickening of the lateral rectus muscle or inflammation. There is a moderate lateral displacement of the intraocular structures, but the globe is intact.
Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, doc?
Doctor: We performed an anterior orbitotomy with biopsy 4 days after your presentation. The pathology was initially read as positive for intermediate grade epithelioid carcinoma, but after an outside consultation, the diagnosis was edited to epithelioid sarcoma with rhabdoid features (proximal type).
Patient: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: Immunohistochemical stains revealed the tumor to be AE1/AE3 strong positive, GATA3 strong positive, vimentin strong positive, EMA focal positive, calponin focal positive, and a series of other markers were negative. This helps us better understand the nature of the tumor.
Patient: Considering my age and the tumor's histology, what are my treatment options?
Doctor: Due to your age and the tumor histology, chemotherapy is not recommended by medical oncology. We completed your staging workup with a soft tissue neck CT, which showed no evidence of abnormal lymph nodes. Additionally, a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT showed no evidence of metastatic disease in your chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Thus, the disease is localized to the left orbit only.
Patient: That's somewhat relieving. What's the plan moving forward?
Doctor: We will closely monitor the lesion and discuss other treatment options with you as needed. It's important to keep an eye on any changes and report them to us immediately.
Patient: Okay, doc. I'll keep a close watch on it and let you know if there are any changes. Thank you for your help.

I noticed a rapidly growing lesion near my left eye about 3 weeks ago, and it's been growing ever since. My primary care physician referred me to you.\nDoctor: I see. Let's take a look at the lesion. Upon examination, it appears to be a medial orbital mass causing ectropion of the lower eyelid and symptomatic epiphora. We should perform a CT scan of the orbits to further investigate this lesion.\nPatient: Alright, doc. What did the CT scan results show?\nDoctor: The CT scan showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.0 cm nonenhancing intraorbital soft tissue lesion abutting the nasal lacrimal duct, lateral and inferior to the globe, without definite osseous remodeling. There is no thickening of the lateral rectus muscle or inflammation. There is a moderate lateral displacement of the intraocular structures, but the globe is intact.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, doc?\nDoctor: We performed an anterior orbitotomy with biopsy 4 days after your presentation. The pathology was initially read as positive for intermediate grade epithelioid carcinoma, but after an outside consultation, the diagnosis was edited to epithelioid sarcoma with rhabdoid features (proximal type).\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: Immunohistochemical stains revealed the tumor to be AE1/AE3 strong positive, GATA3 strong positive, vimentin strong positive, EMA focal positive, calponin focal positive, and a series of other markers were negative. This helps us better understand the nature of the tumor.\nPatient: Considering my age and the tumor's histology, what are my treatment options?\nDoctor: Due to your age and the tumor histology, chemotherapy is not recommended by medical oncology. We completed your staging workup with a soft tissue neck CT, which showed no evidence of abnormal lymph nodes. Additionally, a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT showed no evidence of metastatic disease in your chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Thus, the disease is localized to the left orbit only.\nPatient: That's somewhat relieving. What's the plan moving forward?\nDoctor: We will closely monitor the lesion and discuss other treatment options with you as needed. It's important to keep an eye on any changes and report them to us immediately.\nPatient: Okay, doc. I'll keep a close watch on it and let you know if there are any changes. Thank you for your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. Take care.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of multiple periprosthetic infections in your left knee. Can you tell me more about your past medical history?
Patient: Yeah, I have diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
Patient: Yes, I had a lumbar spinal fusion and multiple failed revision two-stage TKAs for my knee infection.
Doctor: I see. Are you currently taking any medications for your conditions?
Patient: Yes, I'm taking furosemide, gabapentin, carvedilol, lansoprazole, docusate, and enalapril.
Doctor: Good to know. Do you have any documented history of allergies or complications with anesthesia?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: On the day of your operation, we administered cephalexin 2 mg. When we opened your left knee, we found cloudy fluid, which was sent for culture and sensitivities. We debrided and irrigated the infected cement spacers on your femur and tibia. A tobramycin and vancomycin cement mixture formed the new spacer. Intraoperatively, you had brief episodes of hypotension on induction, requiring 3 pressors.
Patient: Oh, I didn't know that.
Doctor: For the duration of the case, you required intermittent pressure support with a total of phenylephrine 360 mcg, epinephrine 30 mcg, and norepinephrine 36 mcg. After the surgery, you were extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Your medications postoperatively included celecoxib 200 mg BID and aspirin 325 mg BID, and we continued you on lansoprazole. We also started you on vancomycin 2 g IV every 12 hours and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours.
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: The cultures revealed that your joint was infected with Corynebacterium striatum, so we discontinued the IV piperacillin-tazobactam.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: On postoperative day 2, you developed a nonoliguric AKI, and your creatinine levels increased from a baseline of 0.9 mg/dl to 1.5 mg/dl.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your kidney function and adjust your medications accordingly. Please make sure to attend your follow-up appointments and let us know if you experience any new symptoms or worsening of your condition.

Patient: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: It means that you had bleeding in the space around your brain and a clot formed in a specific area. The dilatation of the temporal horns indicates some swelling in your brain. We then performed an angiography to further investigate the cause.
Patient: And what did the angiography show?
Doctor: The angiography revealed a ruptured saccular aneurysm of less than 3 mm in diameter, with a neck of 1.5 mm at the origin of your left frontopolar artery. Considering the small size of the aneurysm and its ruptured nature, we decided to manage it conservatively.

Doctor: Yes, unfortunately, the aneurysm bled once more. We obtained another CT scan, which showed a superior interhemispheric frontal haematoma that had opened to your ventricular system. This was classified as Modified Fisher IV.
Patient: What did you do then?
Doctor: On Day 15 after the second haemorrhage, we performed a coiling procedure. After selectively placing a microcatheter in the left frontopolar artery aneurysm, we completely obliterated it with a single coil, maintaining the distal arterial lumen totally permeable.
Patient: Did the procedure work?

"Doctor: Hi, I understand that you're 32 years old and currently at week 22 of your pregnancy. You were admitted to the haematology department with bilateral supraclavicular swelling, diffuse itching, and right shoulder pain. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing these swellings on both sides of my neck, and they've been very itchy. My right shoulder has been hurting a lot too.
Doctor: Alright, we performed an ultrasound imaging and found pathological bilateral supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes. After a biopsy, we diagnosed you with nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: It is a type of cancer, but don't worry. We will do our best to help you. We also performed a fetal ultrasound screening and it showed that your baby is developing normally.
Patient: That's a relief. What's the plan for my treatment?
Doctor: We decided not to perform a combined fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan before delivery due to the risk of radiation exposure during pregnancy. Instead, we used ultrasound and whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) to stage the disease. It showed right cervical, bilateral supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph node involvement without a bulky mass, indicating Stage IIA disease according to Ann Arbor classification.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means the cancer is in the early stages and has not spread extensively. The multidisciplinary team, including haematologists, gynaecologists, radiologists, and neonatologists, decided to start chemotherapy only if clinically necessary. We have been following up with ultrasound, WB-MRI, haematology consults, and gynaecological examinations. We also started therapy with steroid and paracetamol to slow down the progression of the disease and treat your itching and shoulder pain.
Patient: Hmm, okay. And how's my condition now?
Doctor: At pregnancy week 27, WB-MRI demonstrated a slight progression of the disease, seen as an enlargement of the lymph node packages, with the largest in the mediastinum having an axial diameter of 5.4 x 4.5 cm.
Patient: Oh no, what do we do now?
Doctor: Unfortunately, at pregnancy week 29, your clinical conditions got worse, and you presented with coughing, night sweating, numbness, and pain radiating across the shoulder down the arm. An ultrasound examination showed enlargement of a right axillary lymph node and internal jugular vein thrombosis. We treated the thrombosis with enoxaparin, which allowed complete recanalization in just a week. Due to these symptoms and findings, the team decided to start chemotherapy.
Patient: I see. So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We'll perform another WB-MRI to monitor the progression of the disease and ensure the chemotherapy is working effectively. We'll continue with the multidisciplinary follow-up and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to ensure the best possible outcome for both you and your baby.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented with a one-month history of epigastric discomfort. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having this discomfort in my upper stomach area for the past month. It's been quite bothersome.
Doctor: I understand. We performed a physical examination, and it was unremarkable. However, your laboratory examination showed slightly elevated amylase levels. We conducted an abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and found a low-density mass with a diameter of 30 mm at the pancreatic head, with segmental superior mesenteric vein (SMV) attachment. There was neither stenosis nor arteriosclerosis around the celiac axis at that time.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed endoscopic ultrasonography, and a fine-needle biopsy sample showed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Patient: So, it's cancer?
Doctor: Yes, unfortunately. We proceeded with pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with superior mesenteric vein resection and reconstruction. Additionally, a lymphadenectomy including right half dissection of the lymph nodes was performed without the nerve plexus around the celiac trunk. Intraoperative exploration ruled out latent peritoneal or liver metastasis and showed normal anatomy of the celiac trunk, mesenteric vessels, and related branches.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The duration of the surgery was 549 minutes, and the blood loss was 863 mL. Blood transfusion was not performed. We had to mobilize the pancreatic body more than usual for the pancreaticojejunostomy because it was a hard pancreas.
Patient: What happened after the surgery?
Doctor: On postoperative day 3, your liver function tests were still abnormal, and we found bloody fluids in the drain. An abdominal CT showed a characteristic hook-pattern on the anterior proximal celiac axis from compression of the MAL, which had not been detected in the preoperative CT. Ischemic changes in the remnant pancreas, hepatic lateral segment, and gastrojejunostomy site were also observed.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?
Doctor: Although all celiac branches were visible, there were almost no pulsations in those branches. We first tried interventional radiology, but the procedure failed due to tight compression against the outside of the celiac axis.
Patient: So, what was the next step?
Doctor: You underwent an urgent re-laparotomy to address the issue. I'll be monitoring your progress closely and provide further instructions based on your recovery.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've had a mass on my anterior abdominal wall for about a year now. It's been gradually increasing in size and causing me discomfort.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in the mass or your symptoms during certain times, such as during your menstrual cycle?
Patient: Yes, it gets worse during my menses. The mass seems to get bigger and the pain becomes more intense.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Have you had any surgeries in the past, specifically in the abdominal area?
Patient: I had a caesarean section six years ago, but that's it.
Doctor: Alright. I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of the mass. 
Patient: Sure, go ahead.
Doctor: *Examines the patient* I can feel a circumscribed mass measuring approximately 6 cms in diameter in the infraumbilical region to the left of the midline. The mobility of the swelling seems to be restricted when you contract your muscles, which may suggest infiltration of the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures.
Patient: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: It means the mass may be affecting the muscles and tissues beneath the skin. We will need to conduct some laboratory investigations and a CT scan to get a clearer picture. 
Patient: Okay, let's do it.
*After the tests*
Doctor: The laboratory results are within normal limits, and the CT scan revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcutaneous tissues, infiltrating the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures. This is highly suggestive of an abdominal wall endometrioma.
Patient: So, what's the next step for me?
Doctor: The best course of action would be surgical resection. We would remove the endometrioma along with a portion of the underlying aponeurosis and rectus abdominis muscle.
Patient: And after that?
Doctor: We will place a polypropylene mesh over the defect created by the resection and fix it to the anterior rectus sheath with nonabsorbable sutures. This will help to reinforce the area and promote healing.
Patient: What can I expect after the surgery?
Doctor: The postoperative course should be uneventful. We will perform a histopathological evaluation of the resected specimen to ensure clear resection margins. Following the procedure, there should be no seroma at the operative site, and you should experience complete relief of symptoms.
Patient: That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help.","S: The patient reports a mass on the anterior abdominal wall, present for about a year, with gradual increase in size and discomfort. The symptoms exacerbate during her menstrual cycle, with increased size and pain of the mass. She has a history of a caesarean section six years ago.
O: Physical examination revealed a circumscribed, infraumbilical mass approximately 6 cm in diameter, located to the left of the midline with restricted mobility upon muscle contraction. Laboratory tests are within normal limits.

Have you noticed any changes in the mass or your symptoms during certain times, such as during your menstrual cycle?\nPatient: Yes, it gets worse during my menses.

Have you had any surgeries in the past, specifically in the abdominal area?\nPatient: I had a caesarean section six years ago, but that's it.\nDoctor: Alright. I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of the mass. \nPatient: Sure, go ahead.\nDoctor: *Examines the patient* I can feel a circumscribed mass measuring approximately 6 cms in diameter in the infraumbilical region to the left of the midline. The mobility of the swelling seems to be restricted when you contract your muscles, which may suggest infiltration of the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: It means the mass may be affecting the muscles and tissues beneath the skin. We will need to conduct some laboratory investigations and a CT scan to get a clearer picture. \nPatient: Okay, let's do it.\n*After the tests*\nDoctor: The laboratory results are within normal limits, and the CT scan revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcutaneous tissues, infiltrating the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures.

We would remove the endometrioma along with a portion of the underlying aponeurosis and rectus abdominis muscle.\nPatient: And after that?\nDoctor: We will place a polypropylene mesh over the defect created by the resection and fix it to the anterior rectus sheath with nonabsorbable sutures. This will help to reinforce the area and promote healing.\nPatient: What can I expect after the surgery?\nDoctor: The postoperative course should be uneventful.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your medical history, especially regarding alcohol and tobacco use?
Patient: I've been using alcohol and tobacco extensively for many years.
Doctor: I see. What brings you in today?
Patient: For the past 2 months, I've had this progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of my tongue. It's about 5 cm and has even caused an anterior tongue cleft. I've also had unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, and swelling under my jaw.
Doctor: Hmm, have you noticed any lumps in your neck area?
Patient: Yes, I've felt some non-tender lumps on both sides of my neck.
Doctor: It seems you have bilateral palpable lymphadenopathy in levels I, II, and III. Now, I understand you've had biopsies done before by an otolaryngologist. What were the results?
Patient: They didn't find any cancer, but they saw some reactive inflammatory changes.
Doctor: Okay. We also conducted a positron emission tomography scan, which revealed hypermetabolic lesions in your anterior tongue and lymph nodes, suggesting malignancy. The assessment was a likely T3/4N2cM0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. We performed a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. However, the biopsy results again did not show carcinoma but rather granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: A multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy, while laboratory results showed markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels. These findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, so we referred you for a pulmonary consultation.
Patient: I remember that. I also developed some red spots on my extremities, palms, soles, and trunk.
Doctor: Yes, your laboratory evaluation demonstrated T pallidum immunoglobulin G antibodies present with a reflex RPR titer of 1:512. We then analyzed the lymph node biopsy sample with immunohistochemistry (IHC), which revealed spirochetes. You were diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days due to a severe penicillin allergy.
Patient: How am I doing after the treatment?
Doctor: After receiving treatment, your tongue lesion is healing well, but there is still a persistent anterior tongue cleft. It is important for you to follow up with further laboratory evaluations to monitor your progress.
Patient: Alright, I'll make sure to do that. Thank you, Doctor.","S: The patient, a long-term user of alcohol and tobacco, presents with a 2-month history of a progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of the tongue, measuring approximately 5 cm, associated with an anterior tongue cleft.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: For the past 2 months, I've had this progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of my tongue. It's about 5 cm and has even caused an anterior tongue cleft. I've also had unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, and swelling under my jaw.\nDoctor: Hmm, have you noticed any lumps in your neck area?\nPatient: Yes, I've felt some non-tender lumps on both sides of my neck.\nDoctor: It seems you have bilateral palpable lymphadenopathy in levels I, II, and III. Now, I understand you've had biopsies done before by an otolaryngologist. What were the results?\nPatient: They didn't find any cancer, but they saw some reactive inflammatory changes.\nDoctor: Okay. We also conducted a positron emission tomography scan, which revealed hypermetabolic lesions in your anterior tongue and lymph nodes, suggesting malignancy. The assessment was a likely T3/4N2cM0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. We performed a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. However, the biopsy results again did not show carcinoma but rather granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: A multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy, while laboratory results showed markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels. These findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, so we referred you for a pulmonary consultation.\nPatient: I remember that. I also developed some red spots on my extremities, palms, soles, and trunk.\nDoctor: Yes, your laboratory evaluation demonstrated T pallidum immunoglobulin G antibodies present with a reflex RPR titer of 1:512. We then analyzed the lymph node biopsy sample with immunohistochemistry (IHC), which revealed spirochetes. You were diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days due to a severe penicillin allergy.\nPatient: How am I doing after the treatment?\nDoctor: After receiving treatment, your tongue lesion is healing well, but there is still a persistent anterior tongue cleft. It is important for you to follow up with further laboratory evaluations to monitor your progress.\nPatient: Alright, I'll make sure to do that. Thank you, Doctor.""}

"Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having some issues lately and I'm not sure what's going on.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Well, I've been experiencing urinary frequency and nocturia for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. Let's discuss your medical history to better understand your situation. I know you have multiple psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and poor impulse control. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm taking clonidine 0.1 mg three times daily, guanfacine 4 mg daily, bupropion sustained-release 150 mg daily, quetiapine 200 mg twice daily, and lithium 450 mg three times daily. I started lithium when I was 5 years old.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. About a year prior to your presentation, your lithium level was in the range of 0.9–1.1 mmol/L and your serum creatinine was 0.78 mg/dL, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 86 ml/min/1.73 m2 based on the bedside Schwartz formula. We'll need to run some tests to identify any issues.
[After running tests]
Doctor: Your physical examination was unremarkable. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.006, a pH of 6.0, but no hematuria or proteinuria. Blood tests showed a lithium level of 1.4 mmol/L, a TSH of 5.09 uIU/mL (normal 0.55–4.78 uIU/mL), a calcium of 11.1 mg/dL (normal 8.6–10.6 mg/dL), and a creatinine of 1.15 mg/dL.
Patient: Is there anything we should do about it?
Doctor: Your primary care physician (PCP) reduced your lithium dose to 450 mg twice daily and initiated levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. One week later, your lithium level reduced to 1.1 mmol/L. However, over the next couple of weeks, your creatinine increased to 1.3 mg/dL.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Your PCP decided to discontinue the lithium by tapering the dose over the next 3 weeks. Despite a very low lithium level of <0.1 mmol/L four weeks after discontinuation, your serum creatinine continued to increase, prompting a nephrology referral.
Patient: So, what happens now?
Doctor: At your presentation to the nephrology clinic, your physical examination was unremarkable. The nephrologist will further evaluate your condition and determine the best course of action for your treatment.

Doctor: Do you have any history of recent surgery, deep venous thrombosis, or taking oral contraceptives? How about alcohol consumption or smoking cigarettes?
Patient: No, I don't have any of that history, and I don't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.
Doctor: I see. At the other institution, they performed a chest computed tomography (CT) scan which showed scattered small ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field and a well-defined dense shadow in the left lung (Fig. A, B). A chest ultrasound confirmed left pleural effusion. You were diagnosed with double pneumonia and left pleural effusion. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.

Your D-dimer level was 0.02 mg/L. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's all correct.
Doctor: We performed a repeat chest CT scan on the first day after admission, which showed scattered small ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field, but no pleural effusion in the left lung (Fig. C, D). Your ECG revealed sinus rhythm and ST-T wave changes, and myocardial ischemia was suspected.

A chest ultrasound confirmed left pleural effusion. You were diagnosed with double pneumonia and left pleural effusion. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And you received antibiotics for 8 days, which slightly alleviated the left chest pain. Then you were transferred to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. On admission, your clinical parameters were body temperature 36.5°C, pulse 71 beats/min, respiratory rate 15 breaths/min, blood pressure 118/85 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation when breathing room air 98%. Your physical examination was unremarkable, and your white blood cell count, liver function, kidney function, myocardial markers, and brain natriuretic peptide values were normal. Your D-dimer level was 0.02 mg/L. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's all correct.\nDoctor: We performed a repeat chest CT scan on the first day after admission, which showed scattered small ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field, but no pleural effusion in the left lung (Fig. C, D). Your ECG revealed sinus rhythm and ST-T wave changes, and myocardial ischemia was suspected. Echocardiography showed that your ejection fraction was 77%, the right ventricle end-diastolic diameter was 23 mm, tricuspid valve regurgitation, and a valve area of approximately 2.0 cm2. Abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, or kidney. Based on these findings, we suspected double pneumonia and prescribed another course of antibiotics. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: After two days of antibiotics, my left chest pain was alleviated, but then a similar but more severe pain appeared.\nDoctor: I see. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as necessary. Please make sure to follow up with us regularly and let us know if there are any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns. It's important to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics and follow any additional instructions we provide.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and will follow your advice.""}
 {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""S: The patient, a non-smoker and non-drinker with no recent history of surgery, deep venous thrombosis, or oral contraceptive use, presented with persistent left chest pain for over a week, exacerbated by deep breathing.

Laboratory tests including WBC count, liver and kidney function, myocardial markers, and BNP were normal, with a low D-dimer level (0.02 mg/L). Repeat CT scans showed persistent ground-glass opacities but resolved pleural effusion. ECG indicated sinus rhythm with ST-T wave changes, and echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 77%, with tricuspid valve regurgitation. Abdominal ultrasound was normal.\nA: The primary diagnosis remains double pneumonia, with initial suspicion of myocardial ischemia based on ECG changes. The resolution of pleural effusion and improvement in chest pain with antibiotics support the diagnosis of pneumonia. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of chest pain and respiratory symptoms, such as pulmonary embolism, given the initial presentation, but low D-dimer levels make this less likely.\nP: Continue the prescribed course of antibiotics and monitor the patient's response. Regular follow-up is essential to assess the resolution of symptoms and to adjust treatment as necessary.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I ruptured my left Achilles tendon while playing soccer in June 2017 and had a tendon repair. But it re-ruptured after a month and an anastomosis procedure was done.
Doctor: I see. How did the anastomosis procedure go?
Patient: Unfortunately, it failed due to a local infection and skin necrosis.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We can perform reconstructive surgery to address this issue. When did you first experience the initial injury?
Patient: It was 39 days ago.
Doctor: Alright. We've identified Staphylococcus aureus in your bacterial culture results, so we've been giving you a drip infusion of 1g of cefazolin twice a day after hospitalisation until 3 days after the surgery.
Patient: Okay, that's good to know.
Doctor: We've planned a simultaneous reconstruction of your tendon and soft tissue defects using an anterolateral thigh (ALT) and tensor fasciae latae (TFL) muscle chimeric flap, as well as Achilles tendon reconstruction using a TFL flap.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: Surgical repair was performed 55 days after the primary rupture. We identified and marked the cutaneous perforator of the ALT flap on your skin preoperatively with a colour Doppler ultrasonography before the operation.
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: During the operation, we performed a wide debridement which resulted in a large combined Achilles tendon, 7 cm long, and overlying skin defect measuring 5.5 × 11 cm.
Patient: Oh, I didn't realize it was that big.
Doctor: Yes, it was quite significant. We elevated an ALT flap with a 6.5 × 13 cm skin island without fascia and a TFL musculofascial flap with an 11-cm length of iliotibial fascia from your right thigh.
Patient: Got it.
Doctor: In your case, the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA), the pedicle of the ALT flap, branched directly from the deep femoral artery or common femoral artery. As a result, the vascular pedicles of the ALT and TFL flaps were independent of each other.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: We then anastomosed the descending branch of the LCFA with the posterior tibialis vessels in an end-to-side fashion first, while the vascular pedicle of the TFL flap was anastomosed with the side branch of the descending branch of the LCFA in an end-to-end fashion.
Patient: I see. So, what are the next steps for me?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your recovery, and you will need to follow up with us regularly to ensure proper healing. In the meantime, take care of the surgical site, follow any prescribed medications, and avoid strenuous activities that may strain the repaired area.
Patient: Alright, thank you so much for your help, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or notice any unusual symptoms, don't hesitate to contact us. Take care and good luck with your recovery.","S: The patient reports a history of left Achilles tendon rupture initially occurring in June 2017, with subsequent re-rupture and failed repair attempts due to infection and skin necrosis. The patient experienced the initial injury 39 days ago and has been under treatment for a Staphylococcus aureus infection.

Vascular anastomosis was performed between the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and the posterior tibialis vessels, as well as between the vascular pedicle of the TFL flap and the side branch of the descending branch of the LCFA.
A: The primary diagnosis is a recurrent rupture of the left Achilles tendon complicated by infection and significant tissue loss. The differential diagnosis would include chronic infection or non-healing due to underlying vascular or systemic issues.

"Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, my 7.5-year-old son has been having progressive gait disturbance and falls lately.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his history, such as his birth and developmental milestones?
Patient: He had a full-term birth with no pregnancy or delivery complications. He was sitting up without support, walking, and speaking all within the normal range. There is a family history of tremors in his grandfather, though.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Has your son been seen by a pediatric neurologist before?
Patient: Yes, he was first seen at the age of 3.5 years for unsteady gait and toe walking. The gait unsteadiness started around 2.5 years old, and he had frequent falls back then too. Tremors in his hands were noted sometime before that clinic visit.
Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me more about the examination findings at that time?
Patient: The examination showed that he was a well-developed child with a normal funduscopic exam, no cardiac murmur, and normal mental status including speech. He had normal cranial nerves and strength. His deep tendon reflexes were 1+ in both upper and lower extremities with down going toes. His gait was wide based and unsteady, and he had a tremor in both hands.
Doctor: Thank you. Has there been any progression in his condition since then?
Patient: Yes, by the age of 6.5 years, he had more falls and worsening handwriting. His examination revealed pes cavus, mild scoliosis, and absence of cardiac murmur. His neurological exam showed trace to absent deep tendon reflexes, loss of position sense, positive Romberg, downgoing toes, slowed rapid alternating movements, tremor on finger to nose exam, and wide based unsteady gait.
Doctor: I see. Has there been any further progression since then?
Patient: Yes, at 7 years old, he had more frequent falls and worsening handwriting. The examination showed progression with respect to ataxia in upper and lower limbs, wider based gait, absent deep tendon reflexes, and a positive Babinski sign.
Doctor: How is he doing now, around the age of 7.5 years?
Patient: He's falling more, and the latest examination showed increased tone in his lower extremities with foot drop and steppage gait. He also has decreased proprioception in the lower extremities and inconsistent responses in the upper extremities.
Doctor: Thank you for providing all the details. Has he had any imaging done, such as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain?
Patient: Yes, he had an MRI of the brain, and it came back normal.
Doctor: Alright. Based on the information you've provided, it's important to continue monitoring his condition and follow up with his pediatric neurologist. They will be able to advise on potential treatment options and any necessary adjustments to his care. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.","S: The patient, a 7.5-year-old male, presents with progressive gait disturbance and frequent falls.

He has a history of unsteady gait and toe walking noted since 2.5 years old, with initial pediatric neurology consultation at 3.5 years. Family history includes tremors in his grandfather. The patient's developmental milestones were achieved within the normal range. Symptoms have progressively worsened, with recent increases in falls, handwriting difficulties, and changes in tone and proprioception.\nO: Past examinations revealed a well-developed child with normal funduscopic and cardiac exams, normal cranial nerves, strength, and mental status. Initial deep tendon reflexes were 1+ with downgoing toes. Subsequent exams showed pes cavus, mild scoliosis, trace to absent deep tendon reflexes, loss of position sense, positive Romberg, slowed rapid alternating movements, tremor on finger to nose exam, and a wide-based unsteady gait. Most recent findings include increased tone in lower extremities, foot drop, steppage gait, decreased proprioception in lower extremities, and inconsistent responses in upper extremities. MRI of the brain was normal.\nA: The patient's clinical presentation and history suggest a progressive neurological disorder, possibly a form of hereditary ataxia or neuromuscular condition, given the family history and symptomatology. Differential diagnoses could include Friedreich's ataxia or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The normal MRI findings rule out some causes but do not eliminate these possibilities.\nP: Plan to continue regular follow-ups with the pediatric neurologist for ongoing assessment and management. Consider genetic testing to explore hereditary conditions. Physical therapy is recommended to address gait abnormalities and prevent complications from falls. Occupational therapy may help with handwriting difficulties. Monitor neurological status regularly and adjust care as needed. Educate the family on the nature of progressive neurological disorders and ensure they have access to supportive resources.""}]",[],"S: The patient's 7.5-year-old son presents with progressive gait disturbance and frequent falls. The patient reports a history of a full-term birth with no pregnancy or delivery complications. The child has a family history of tremors in his grandfather.
O: Physical examination revealed a well-developed child with a normal funduscopic exam, no cardiac murmur, and normal mental status including speech. Neurological examination showed pes cavus, mild scoliosis, and absence of cardiac murmur. Deep tendon reflexes were 1+ in both upper and lower extremities, with a tremor in both hands. Gait was wide based and unsteady, with a wide-based gait and frequent falls. The child's handwriting has worsened since the age of 6.5 years.
A: The primary diagnosis is progressive gait disturbance and frequent falls in a well-developed child with a history of a full-term birth with no pregnancy or delivery complications. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of gait disturbance, such as neurological disorders or developmental abnormalities.
P: The management plan will include continued monitoring of the child's neurological status and gait progression. The child will be referred to a pediatric neurologist for further evaluation and management of the gait disturbance and falls. The child's family will be educated on the importance of monitoring the child's condition and adherence to follow-up appointments. "
"Doctor: Hi there, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you've been admitted to the Emergency Department due to agitation and an altered consciousness. Can you tell me when these symptoms started?
Patient: Hey, doctor. They started just a few hours ago, and I've been feeling a progressive loss of verbal contact.
Doctor: I understand. Your medical history shows that you have arterial hypertension, which is treated with atenolol. When you were admitted, your Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 9/15 with moderate neck stiffness. Your pupils were mid-size, reactive, and symmetric. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your vital signs showed a body temperature of 36.6°C, arterial blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg, heart rate of 120/min, and respiratory rate of 60/min. We performed a brain computed tomography (CT) without iodinated contrast agent perfusion before the lumbar puncture, and it didn't reveal any significant abnormalities. Due to your progressive respiratory distress, intubation was required. 
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also conducted a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 560/μl, with 99% granulocytes, proteins at 1264 mg/dl, glucose at 3 mg/dl, and lactate at 27 mmol/l.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: The CSF and blood cultures tested positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is sensitive to penicillin G and ceftriaxone. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.016 mcg/ml for penicillin G and ceftriaxone in the CSF, and 0.012 and 0.008 mcg/ml in blood for penicillin G and ceftriaxone, respectively.
Patient: So, what's the treatment plan?
Doctor: We've started you on a combination of dexamethasone (10 mg q6h for 4 days) and ceftriaxone (2 g q12h for 14 days). After 10 days, we'll repeat the CSF analysis to confirm the drop in WBC count and eradication of the causative microorganism.
Patient: Alright, thank you.
Doctor: However, I have to inform you that you've been referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to the worsening of your GCS score, which is now 6/15. Even though there's no evidence of acute hydrocephalus, we'll be monitoring your intracranial pressure (ICP).
Patient: I understand, doctor. Thank you for letting me know.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you recover. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're here today with a chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and decreased level of consciousness. Can you tell me more about these symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been feeling really nauseous and tired lately, and sometimes it's hard for me to stay awake or focused.
Doctor: I understand. Let me give you a brief overview of your medical history. You were referred to the Neurology Department of Namazi Hospital in 2016. You were delivered through cesarean section due to oligohydramnios, with a birth weight of 2700 grams and body length of 48 cm. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: You also have a short neck and trunk, pectus carinatum, and kyphosis. The first problem you experienced was at five months of age when growth retardation was detected in a routine workup. Your dental age was also delayed compared to your chronological age. Do you recall that?
Patient: Yeah, I remember my parents telling me about that.
Doctor: Additionally, a bone survey showed delayed bone age, J-shaped sella, periarticular and diffused osteopenia, and flattening of thoracic vertebrae. At 11 months old, you developed a urinary tract infection, and a voiding cystourethrogram diagnosed bilateral vesicoureteral reflux. Your kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder ultrasonography, as well as renal scintigraphy, were normal. Can you confirm this?
Patient: Yes, that sounds right.
Doctor: When you were 4 years old, a urine analysis showed proteinuria for the first time, and after more workups, nephrotic syndrome was confirmed. Did you have any new problems after that?
Patient: No, not until I was 6 years old.
Doctor: At the age of 6, you developed sudden onset right upper extremity paresthesia and weakness. A brain MRI showed ischemic and hemorrhagic infarct in the left parieto-occipital and left caudate lobe. Brain Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) revealed significant wall irregularity of both internal carotid arteries, left Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), basilar artery, and left Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA). Your MRI of the cervical spine was normal. Can you tell me more about those symptoms?
Patient: I remember feeling sudden tingling and weakness in my right arm around that time.
Doctor: Two years later, you developed slurred speech and paresthesia, and the weakness progressed to your lower extremities. A brain MRI revealed new acute ischemic infarction in the right temporoparietal lobe. Encephalomalacia with surrounding gliosis was also detected. How have these symptoms affected you?
Patient: It's been difficult. My speech got worse, and the tingling and weakness spread to my legs.
Doctor: I understand that this must be very challenging for you. We will continue to monitor and manage your symptoms. It's important to keep up with your follow-up appointments and to let us know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma back in 2013. I had a biopsy done after an endoscopic control examination. I was treated with radio adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery. I'm here for a follow-up appointment.
Doctor: I see. How have you been feeling since your treatments?
Patient: I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The combination of treatments led to a complete response, and there were no residual cancer areas or lymph node involvement documented on the surgical piece.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Let's discuss your recent check-up. In 2018, during your regular oncological follow-up, a subpleural pulmonary nodule was detected in the lower lobe of your left lung. It measured about 15x10 mm. Considering your clinical history, general conditions, and the localization of the lesion, a surgical resection of the lung was performed. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: On the macroscopic exam of the sample, physicians observed a neoformation measuring 1.9x1.5x0.6 cm, which was whitish, solid, with irregular but well-defined margins. It was 0.6 cm away from the surgical suture and 0.1 cm from the visceral pleura. The histologic examination demonstrated an epitheliomorphic neoplasm with acinar differentiation.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and had scattered positivity for caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2). They were also strongly and diffusely positive for TTF-1. However, the tumor cells were negative for CK7 and Napsin A. A retrospective review of your previous primary tumor tissue showed similar histologic findings with TTF-1 positivity.
Patient: So, what's the diagnosis?
Doctor: Based on the positivity for CK20 and CDX2, and the negative results for CK7 and Napsin A, along with the morphology of the lesion, the diagnosis is metastasis from TTF1-positive primary colorectal adenocarcinoma.
Patient: Oh, I see. What should I do next?
Doctor: We will need to closely monitor your condition and discuss appropriate treatment options with your oncologist. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to ensure the best possible outcome.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or concerns. Take care, and we'll see you at your next appointment.","S: The patient, previously diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma in 2013, treated with radio adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, reports feeling good with no residual cancer areas or lymph node involvement post-treatment.

Doctor: I see. We performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and found type III esophageal cancer in the middle thoracic esophagus, and type II gastric cancer in the cardia. A computed tomography (CT) scan also revealed a left renal tumor and multiple swollen lymph nodes in your neck, mediastinum, and abdomen, including the left renal hilar and para-aortic regions.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with multiple primary cancers of the esophagus (T3N3M0), stomach (T2N1M0), and kidney (T1bN1M0), according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 7th edition.
Patient: What's the treatment plan for this?
Doctor: We started with two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using nedaplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Then, we performed a two-stage operation to decrease the surgical stress. The first-stage operation involved preoperative percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, followed by thoracoscopic subtotal esophagectomy in the prone position, and cervical esophagostomy placement with mediastinal and cervical lymphadenectomy.
Patient: How did the operation go?
Doctor: The operation was uneventful. It involved 29 mL of blood loss and took 284 minutes to complete. We started gastrostomy feeding on postoperative day (POD) 3 with a polymeric formula at a rate of 20 mL/h for 15 hours per day, increasing the rate to 40, 60, and 80 mL/h for 15 hours per day on POD 5, 6, and 7, respectively.
Patient: I remember that. But on POD 7, I developed diarrhea and acute abdominal pain with distension and bloody drainage through the gastrostomy tube.
Doctor: Yes, when we examined you, your temperature was 37.2 °C, but your other vital signs were normal. Your abdomen was distended with mild diffuse tenderness, but there was no guarding or rigidity.
Patient: What were the results of the laboratory evaluation?
Doctor: Your laboratory evaluation showed an elevated white blood cell count of 11.9 × 109/L and a C-reactive protein level of 59.0 mg/L. Arterial blood gas analysis showed no signs of metabolic acidosis.
Patient: What are the next steps for my treatment and recovery?

"Doctor: Hi there, I see that you've presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of right arm and leg weakness that started around 3 hours prior to admission. Can you tell me more about your recent health?
Patient: Yeah, I had a viral illness about 5 days ago. I felt really tired, had a fever, and even vomited and had diarrhea.
Doctor: I see. Were you seen by a pediatrician during that time?
Patient: Yes, they said I had mild dehydration and suggested oral rehydration and antipyretics for my fever.
Doctor: That's a good course of action. And are your immunizations up-to-date?
Patient: Yes, they are.
Doctor: Great. Upon arrival, we did a physical exam and noticed flaccidity in your right upper and lower extremities. We also took X-rays of your right arm to rule out any trauma, but the results were negative. 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Additionally, we found that you have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL, and thrombocytosis, with a platelet count of 512,000. 
Patient: Oh, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that your red blood cells are smaller than normal, and you have an increased number of platelets in your blood. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head without contrast, which showed hypodensity of the left thalamus and high attenuation throughout the bilateral deep venous system, compatible with acute DCVT.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: It is a concerning finding, but we've already initiated anticoagulation therapy and IV hydration to address the issue. After discussing the radiologic findings with the ED physician, we decided to transfer you to the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary pediatric hospital.
Patient: What will happen there?
Doctor: We'll perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain, which will help us assess the extent of the issue. The MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in the central aspect of the thalamus, surrounded by vasogenic edema, indicating an acute venous infarction. Thankfully, no other parenchymal lesions were detected. 
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We also conducted an MR venography, which confirmed a lack of flow-related signal throughout the deep venous system. You'll have a follow-up MR venography done two days later before discharge. At that time, there was no significant interval change, but we did find a relatively stable venous infarct in the left thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule.
Patient: Will I recover from this?
Doctor: Your symptoms resolved completely after six months of physical and speech therapy, with no residual symptoms. You'll be closely followed by pediatric neurology to ensure your continued recovery.
Patient: I'm glad to hear that. Thank you, doctor.","S: The patient, a pediatric individual, presented with sudden onset of right arm and leg weakness approximately 3 hours prior to admission. The patient reported a recent viral illness characterized by fatigue, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea approximately 5 days ago, treated with oral rehydration and antipyretics. The patient confirmed that immunizations are up-to-date.
O: Physical examination revealed flaccidity in the right upper and lower extremities. X-rays of the right arm were negative for trauma. Lab results indicated microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL (normal: 12-16 g/dL) and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 512,000 (normal: 150,000-450,000). A CT scan of the head showed hypodensity of the left thalamus and high attenuation in the bilateral deep venous system, suggestive of acute deep cerebral venous thrombosis (DCVT). MRI of the brain demonstrated restricted diffusion in the central aspect of the thalamus with surrounding vasogenic edema, indicative of acute venous infarction, and MR venography confirmed lack of flow-related signal in the deep venous system.
A: The primary diagnosis is acute deep cerebral venous thrombosis with resultant venous infarction in the left thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule.

Can you tell me more about your recent health?\nPatient: Yeah, I had a viral illness about 5 days ago. I felt really tired, had a fever, and even vomited and had diarrhea.\nDoctor: I see. Were you seen by a pediatrician during that time?\nPatient: Yes, they said I had mild dehydration and suggested oral rehydration and antipyretics for my fever.\nDoctor: That's a good course of action. And are your immunizations up-to-date?\nPatient: Yes, they are.\nDoctor: Great. Upon arrival, we did a physical exam and noticed flaccidity in your right upper and lower extremities. We also took X-rays of your right arm to rule out any trauma, but the results were negative. \nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: Additionally, we found that you have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL, and thrombocytosis, with a platelet count of 512,000. \nPatient: Oh, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that your red blood cells are smaller than normal, and you have an increased number of platelets in your blood. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head without contrast, which showed hypodensity of the left thalamus and high attenuation throughout the bilateral deep venous system, compatible with acute DCVT.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: It is a concerning finding, but we've already initiated anticoagulation therapy and IV hydration to address the issue. After discussing the radiologic findings with the ED physician, we decided to transfer you to the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary pediatric hospital.\nPatient: What will happen there?\nDoctor: We'll perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain, which will help us assess the extent of the issue. The MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in the central aspect of the thalamus, surrounded by vasogenic edema, indicating an acute venous infarction. Thankfully, no other parenchymal lesions were detected. \nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We also conducted an MR venography, which confirmed a lack of flow-related signal throughout the deep venous system. You'll have a follow-up MR venography done two days later before discharge. At that time, there was no significant interval change, but we did find a relatively stable venous infarct in the left thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule.\nPatient: Will I recover from this?\nDoctor: Your symptoms resolved completely after six months of physical and speech therapy, with no residual symptoms. You'll be closely followed by pediatric neurology to ensure your continued recovery.\nPatient: I'm glad to hear that. Thank you, doctor.""}

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing some gradually progressing weakness in my right arm.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history? Any notable illnesses or conditions?
Patient: I had asthma when I was a child, but that's about it. No family history of anything major.
Doctor: Alright. Let's do a physical examination to check for any abnormalities. *examines patient* I see some mild paralysis in your right arm. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like palpitations or sweating?
Patient: Yes, I do feel palpitations and sweating sometimes.
Doctor: Alright. I'm not observing any exophthalmic or enlarged thyroid lobes. We'll need to conduct some tests to understand your condition better. We'll start with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).
*After the tests*
Doctor: Your DWI results showed cortical and subcortical infarcts in the left MCA territory, but your MRA showed almost normal cerebral arteries with very mild stenosis of the left ICA. The vessel wall in the left ICA seems slightly thicker than the right, but the difference isn't very clear.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: We've identified hyperthyroidism in your blood test results. Your levels of free T3, free T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are 10.58 pg/mL, 2.70 ng/dL, and 0.01 μU/mL, respectively. Additionally, we found autoantibodies related to Graves' Disease, such as anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab, 148.0 IU/mL) and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb, 8.3 IU/mL).
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Other laboratory investigations showed leukopenia, anti-SS-A antibody (89.5 IU/mL), anti-SS-B antibody (12.4 IU/mL), and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT, 2.5 ng/mL). Your C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were negative.
Patient: Is that something to be concerned about?
Doctor: Based on these results, we've diagnosed you with Graves' Disease, but not Sjogren's syndrome, as the normal results of Schirmer's test and unstimulated salivary flow rate test ruled it out.
Patient: I see. What's the next step?
Doctor: We'll need to start treatment for your Graves' Disease and monitor your progress. I'll also want you to come back for regular checkups to ensure your symptoms improve and your thyroid hormone levels return to normal.
Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!","S: The patient reports gradually progressing weakness in the right arm, accompanied by occasional palpitations and sweating. The patient has a history of childhood asthma but no significant family medical history.
O: Physical examination revealed mild paralysis in the right arm. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) indicated cortical and subcortical infarcts in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed almost normal cerebral arteries with very mild stenosis of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) and slightly thicker vessel walls compared to the right. Blood tests confirmed hyperthyroidism with elevated free T3 (10.58 pg/mL, normal range: 2.0-4.4 pg/mL), free T4 (2.70 ng/dL, normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), and suppressed TSH (0.01 μU/mL, normal range: 0.4-4.0 μU/mL). Positive autoantibodies related to Graves' Disease were detected: anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab, 148.0 IU/mL) and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb, 8.3 IU/mL). Other laboratory findings included leukopenia, anti-SS-A antibody (89.5 IU/mL), anti-SS-B antibody (12.4 IU/mL), and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT, 2.5 ng/mL). C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were negative. Schirmer's test and unstimulated salivary flow rate test ruled out Sjogren's syndrome.

Differential diagnosis included cerebrovascular ischemia due to infarcts in the left MCA territory, but no significant stenosis or vessel wall abnormalities were observed to confirm a vascular cause. The presence of leukopenia and positive anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies raised a suspicion for an autoimmune disorder, but Sjogren's syndrome was ruled out.
P: Initiate treatment for Graves' Disease with appropriate anti-thyroid medications and possibly beta-blockers to manage symptoms. Regular monitoring of thyroid function tests and adjustment of therapy as needed. Follow-up appointments for physical examination and repeat imaging studies to monitor progression or resolution of cerebral infarcts.

"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me about the accident you had back in 1995?
Patient: Yes, I was 25 years old and riding my bicycle to work when I collided with a van parked on the bicycle lane.
Doctor: I see. And after that accident, you were diagnosed with a C-6/C-7 dislocation and C-8 AIS A tetraplegia, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: How have you been managing your bladder since your rehabilitation?
Patient: My caregivers have been helping me with intermittent catheterisations and intra-vesical instillation of oxybutynin 5 mg solution, four times a day.
Doctor: Have you experienced any issues with your bladder recently?
Patient: Yes, in 2014, I started having recurring bladder spasms and urine leakages between intermittent catheterisations.
Doctor: And were you able to retain the oxybutynin instillations?
Patient: No, the solution would come out as soon as it went inside the bladder.
Doctor: Did you experience any other symptoms during that time?
Patient: I had symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia like blotches on my legs, sharp pain in my head, hot feeling on my face, and bladder pain with spasms.
Doctor: Were those symptoms relieved after catheterisation?
Patient: The blotches went away, and my headache was relieved, but the warm sensation and bladder pain persisted.
Doctor: I understand that you were prescribed mirabegron 50 mg once a day from June 2014 to January 2015. Did that help with your urine leakages?
Patient: No, it made no difference.
Doctor: And then you were prescribed oxybutynin by mouth and transdermal application from January 2015, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: You've also been taking oral baclofen since 1995. Did that have any effect on your bladder spasms?
Patient: No, but it did reduce spasms in my back and legs.
Doctor: How often have you needed to catheterise lately?
Patient: Every couple of hours.
Doctor: And how has this affected your quality of life?
Patient: It's been difficult to cope with physically and mentally. I don't want to live with a permanent catheter and urine bag.
Doctor: Have you tried using a permanent catheter for social occasions?
Patient: Yes, but sometimes I would still bypass.","S: The patient, a 51-year-old with a history of C-6/C-7 dislocation and C-8 AIS A tetraplegia from a bicycle accident in 1995, reports managing bladder function with intermittent catheterizations and intra-vesical instillation of oxybutynin 5 mg solution four times daily. Since 2014, the patient has experienced recurring bladder spasms and urine leakages between catheterizations, which have not improved with mirabegron or oral/transdermal oxybutynin. The patient also describes symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia, including blotches on legs, severe headaches, facial heat, and persistent bladder pain. Baclofen has been used since 1995 to manage muscle spasms but has no effect on bladder spasms.
O: The patient's current management includes intermittent catheterization every couple of hours, intra-vesical oxybutynin, and oral baclofen. Previous treatments with mirabegron and additional oxybutynin modalities were ineffective. The patient experiences significant physical and mental challenges due to frequent catheterizations and persistent symptoms.
A: Primary diagnosis is chronic bladder management issues secondary to C-8 AIS A tetraplegia with symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. Differential diagnoses could include complications from long-term catheter use such as bladder irritation or infection. The lack of response to mirabegron and oxybutynin suggests a complex bladder dysfunction possibly resistant to standard antimuscarinic treatments.
P: Continue current regimen of intermittent catheterization and intra-vesical oxybutynin. Consider consultation with a urologist for evaluation of alternative bladder management strategies, such as botulinum toxin injections or nerve stimulation therapies. Explore options for managing autonomic dysreflexia and its symptoms more effectively. Provide psychological support and counseling to address the patient's mental health concerns related to chronic illness management.

Did that help with your urine leakages?\nPatient: No, it made no difference.\nDoctor: And then you were prescribed oxybutynin by mouth and transdermal application from January 2015, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: You've also been taking oral baclofen since 1995. Did that have any effect on your bladder spasms?\nPatient: No, but it did reduce spasms in my back and legs.\nDoctor: How often have you needed to catheterise lately?\nPatient: Every couple of hours.\nDoctor: And how has this affected your quality of life?\nPatient: It's been difficult to cope with physically and mentally. I don't want to live with a permanent catheter and urine bag.\nDoctor: Have you tried using a permanent catheter for social occasions?\nPatient: Yes, but sometimes I would still bypass.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I wanted to discuss the case of the two-year-old wild female cheetah from the temporary holding facility that developed seizures, raised tail, and arched back in November 2008. 
Patient's Family: Yes, we remember. She passed away despite the treatment. 
Doctor: That's correct. After her passing, she was submitted to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa for a necropsy examination. She was part of a project to re-establish cheetah populations in protected, fenced reserves. The goal was to ensure the animals were fit and able to hunt effectively before being released.
Patient's Family: Yes, we know they went through a re-wilding process in a 1 ha enclosure initially.
Doctor: Exactly. While in the enclosure, antelope and birds were shot on the reserve as cheetah food. Once the cheetahs were able to open and feed off a full carcass, they were released from the enclosure and monitored intensively. The management, handling, and feeding schedules were consistent among the female and three males. Unfortunately, the female was the only mortality.
Patient's Family: That's so sad. What did the necropsy reveal?
Doctor: Due to delayed presentation, tissue preservation in the cheetah was poor. We examined a representative sample of all tissues except the eye and spinal cord. Both macroscopic and histological features were non-specific and non-diagnostic.
Patient's Family: Were there any other significant findings?
Doctor: Yes, we found four lead pellet fragments of less than one millimeter diameter in the cheetah's stomach. Tissue lead concentrations of 15.6 ppm and 17 ppm (wet weight) for kidney and liver respectively were determined at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute Toxicology Department using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. These findings were highly suggestive of lead poisoning.
Patient's Family: How did you confirm it was lead poisoning?
Doctor: Organ samples and blanks were acid digested and compared with standard lead solutions. The results confirmed the diagnosis of lead poisoning.
Patient's Family: Oh no, that's terrible. Thank you for letting us know and for conducting the examination.","S: The patient, a two-year-old wild female cheetah, exhibited symptoms of seizures, a raised tail, and an arched back in November 2008.

O: Post-mortem examination at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa revealed poor tissue preservation, with non-specific and non-diagnostic macroscopic and histological features. However, four lead pellet fragments were found in the stomach, and tissue lead concentrations were 15.6 ppm in the kidney and 17 ppm in the liver, confirmed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute Toxicology Department.
A: The primary diagnosis for the cheetah was lead poisoning, based on the presence of lead pellets in the stomach and elevated lead levels in the kidney and liver tissues. Differential diagnoses were limited due to non-specific macroscopic and histological findings.
P: As the cheetah has passed away, the immediate plan includes reporting the findings to the relevant wildlife and conservation authorities to prevent similar cases. Recommendations will be made to investigate the source of the lead pellets and assess the risk to other animals in the re-wilding program.

Doctor: Have you been eating a balanced diet and drinking moderately?
Patient: Yes, I have been.
Doctor: Is there any family history of similar symptoms?
Patient: No, there's no family history of this.
Doctor: Alright. We conducted a neurological examination and found no disturbance of consciousness or cranial nerve abnormalities. No muscle weakness was present in your neck or upper extremities, but mild weakness was evident in the lower limbs. Have you experienced any severe pain during daily physical activities?
Patient: Yes, I've had severe pain in my gastrocnemius muscles, and they're quite tender.
Doctor: We also observed that the deep tendon reflexes in your lower legs were hypoactive, and mild distal-dominant hypoesthesia in both legs. We did a blood examination and found mild hepatic dysfunction. Your serum creatine kinase (CK) was not elevated at 39 U/L, and neither myoglobin nor aldolase were elevated at 13.1 ng/ml and 5.1 U/L, respectively.
Patient: What about my thiamine levels?
Doctor: Your serum thiamine level was low at 12 ng/ml. We examined it three times and confirmed the low levels in all three determinations. We also conducted investigations, including gastrointestinal endoscopy and blood examination, to explore the cause of thiamine deficiency, such as malabsorption, obstruction, hyperthyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. However, we couldn't identify the obvious cause for the low levels of thiamine.
Patient: Were my other vitamin levels okay?
Doctor: Yes, your levels of vitamin B2, B12, and folic acid were within the normal range.
Patient: What about autoantibodies? Did you find any?
Doctor: All the autoantibodies tested were negative, including antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, paraneoplastic autoantibodies, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies.
Patient: And my cerebrospinal fluid?
Doctor: The cerebrospinal fluid was normal, and the IgG levels were within the normal limits as well.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition and explore possible causes of your symptoms. In the meantime, we'll work on a treatment plan to help manage your pain and muscle weakness. Please make sure to follow up with us regularly so we can track your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment.","S: The patient, with no relevant past medical history, presented with a month-long history of lumbago and leg pain, followed by muscle weakness in the lower limbs two weeks later.

"Doctor: Hi, I see that you were admitted to our hospital with a history of hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and fever for the past two weeks. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired and I've been having night sweats. My knees have been hurting on both sides, and I noticed a rash on my back and chest.
Doctor: I understand. And, prior to this admission, did you experience any other symptoms?
Patient: About two months ago, I started having a nonproductive cough, and I felt weak all over with muscle pain.
Doctor: Okay, and were you prescribed any medications for these musculoskeletal symptoms?
Patient: Yes, my primary care doctor gave me prednisone 20 mg daily for five days, but it didn't help.
Doctor: Alright. At the time of admission, we recorded your blood pressure to be 130/69 mmHg, heart rate at 99 bpm, temperature at 37.8°C (100°F), and a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. We also found bilateral diffuse rales on chest auscultation and a morbilliform rash on your back and upper chest. We conducted some laboratory studies to further investigate your condition.
Patient: What did those tests show?
Doctor: Your white blood cell count was 13.2 × 103/ml, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 122 mm/hour, which is significantly higher than the reference rate of <20 mm/hour. Your hemoglobin was 10.4 g/dl, serum creatinine was 1.48 mg/dl, which is above the reference range of 0.6–1.1 mg/dl, and your glomerular filtration rate was 57 ml/min/1.73 m2, which is lower than the reference rate of >90 ml/min. The urinalysis showed proteinuria and hematuria with few red blood cell casts.
Patient: That doesn't sound good. What does that mean?
Doctor: These results indicate some issues with your kidneys and increased inflammation in your body. We also conducted a chest radiograph that demonstrated diffuse nodular reticular interstitial opacities and right upper lobe cavitation.
Patient: What happened next?
Doctor: Due to respiratory failure, you were admitted to the intensive care unit and intubated to assist with your breathing. We did a computed tomography scan of your chest, which revealed a 4.7-cm right upper lobe cavitary lesion and multiple bilateral nodules in a miliary pattern throughout the lungs with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Patient: What do you think is causing all of this?
Doctor: Based on your clinical features and imaging findings, we believe an infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis is the main cause of your symptoms. As a result, we've decided to start you on empirical treatment with rifampin, which is a medication commonly used to treat tuberculosis.
Patient: I see. How long will I be on this treatment?

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you were diagnosed with stage IV transverse colon cancer and have undergone chemotherapy treatments in another hospital. Can you tell me about your experience with the treatments so far?
Patient: Yes, I started with the mFOLFOX6 therapy, which included modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, along with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF-A antibody. I had 23 courses of that over a year, and it didn't cause many side effects.
Doctor: I see. However, your cancer has been categorized as progressive disease after that treatment. So, what was the next course of action?
Patient: My doctors started me on secondary therapy, which was FOLFIRI, with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan, plus ramucirumab, an anti-VEGFR2 antibody.
Doctor: And how did your body respond to that treatment?
Patient: After 2 courses of the therapy, I started developing anasarca and nephrotic syndrome.
Doctor: I see you were referred to our nephrology clinic and admitted to our hospital on day 44 after the treatment. Let's discuss your blood test results. You had thrombocytopenia with platelets at 57,000/μL, slight normocytic anemia with hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL, mild hypoalbuminemia at 3.0 g/dL, and a mild increase in lactate dehydrogenase level at 433 IU/L. Schistocytes were not found in your peripheral blood smear, and your haptoglobin level was not measured. Your urinary protein was 5.1 g/g-creatinine, and dysmorphic erythrocytes were found in your urine. 
Patient: Hmm, that sounds concerning. What does it all mean?
Doctor: A renal biopsy was performed on day 45, which showed fibrin thrombi within capillary loops, mesangiolysis, and double contour of the basement membrane of glomeruli. Immunofluorescence indicated weak deposition of IgM, fibrinogen, and C1q in mesangio-capillary regions. An electron micrograph showed diffuse endothelial swelling with obliteration of capillary lumina. The pathology was diagnosed as renal-limited TMA. Other causes of nephrotic syndrome, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, were ruled out.
Patient: So, was it the ramucirumab that caused all this?
Doctor: Yes, it appears that ramucirumab is the likely cause of your TMA. Since the biopsy, the ramucirumab treatment has been discontinued.
Patient: What should I expect now?
Doctor: By 6 weeks (day 69) after your last ramucirumab injection, your thrombocytopenia should be resolved, and your platelet count should return to normal levels. We will closely monitor your progress and determine the next steps in your treatment based on your response to the cessation of ramucirumab. 
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.","S: The patient, previously diagnosed with stage IV transverse colon cancer, reported undergoing mFOLFOX6 therapy with minimal side effects, followed by progressive disease. Subsequent treatment with FOLFIRI and ramucirumab led to the development of anasarca and nephrotic syndrome after two courses. The patient expressed concerns about the implications of recent abnormal lab results and symptoms.
O: Vital signs were not provided. Lab results showed thrombocytopenia (platelets at 57,000/μL), normocytic anemia (hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (3.0 g/dL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (433 IU/L), urinary protein at 5.1 g/g-creatinine, and dysmorphic erythrocytes in urine.

Referral to a renal specialist for ongoing management of nephrotic syndrome and a consultation with an oncologist to discuss further cancer treatment options are planned.'}]",[],"S: The patient, diagnosed with stage IV transverse colon cancer, underwent chemotherapy in another hospital, followed by secondary therapy with FOLFIRI, bevacizumab, and ramucirumab. Post-treatment, the patient developed anasarca and nephrotic syndrome.
O: Blood test results showed thrombocytopenia with platelets at 57,000/μL, slight normocytic anemia with hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL, mild hypoalbuminemia at 3.0 g/dL, mild hypoalbuminemia at 3.0 g/dL, and a mild increase in lactate dehydrogenase level at 433 IU/L. Schistocytes were not found in the peripheral blood smear, and haptoglobin levels were not measured. Urinary protein was 5.1 g/g-creatinine, and dysmorphic erythrocytes were found in the urine. Immunofluorescence indicated weak deposition of IgM, fibrinogen, and C1q in mesangio-capillary regions. Electron micrograph showed diffuse endothelial swelling with obliteration of capillary lumina.
A: The primary diagnosis is renal-limited TMA, likely caused by ramucirumab. The patient's thrombocytopenia and subsequent development of anasarca and nephrotic syndrome are related to the ramucirumab treatment.
P: The management plan includes discontinuation of ramucirumab and monitoring of thrombocytopenia. The patient will be closely monitored to ensure resolution of the thrombocytopenia and the return of normal platelet levels. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. The patient will be educated on the importance of adherence to the treatment plan and the potential side effects of the therapy. "
"Doctor: Hello, it's nice to meet you. Can you please tell me about your medical history and any recent symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Hi, I am a 63-year-old female, a former smoker. I have hypothyroidism, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Back in 2001, I had some generalized xanthomatous skin lesions.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort lately?
Patient: Yes, I had abdominal pain back in 2004, and that's when my doctor suggested a computed tomography (CT) scan of my upper abdomen.
Doctor: I see. Did they use contrast for the CT scan?
Patient: Yes, they did.
Doctor: The CT scan with contrast demonstrated hypoattenuating tissue involving the abdominal aorta and its branches. This led to a discrete segmental narrowing of some vessels, characterized by narrowing of the aorta in the emergence region of the renal arteries and the left subclavian artery. Did they perform a tissue biopsy after the scan?
Patient: Yes, they took a biopsy, and it showed the presence of a pseudotumor.
Doctor: That biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD). Did they also perform an 18-FDG PET-CT scan to assess the extent of the disease?
Patient: Yes, they did.
Doctor: The FDG PET-CT showed signs of retroperitoneal fibrosis involving the abdominal aorta immediately above and at the emergence region of the renal arteries. There was also infiltrative tissue surrounding the aortic arch, descending aorta, and left common iliac artery. Did they check for any cardiac involvement?
Patient: They did a cardiac MRI, and it showed normal-sized chambers and preserved systolic function.
Doctor: That's good to hear. The cardiac MRI ruled out any cardiac involvement, which is a positive sign. It's essential to keep monitoring your condition and manage your hypothyroidism, hypertension, and dyslipidemia to prevent any complications.

Doctor: I see. Have you had any imaging done, like a thoracic computed tomography (CT)?
Patient: Yes, the CT showed bilateral bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction.
Doctor: Okay, we performed a sweat test to further investigate. It showed borderline values of sweat chloride two times, 52 and 41 mmol/L. We then initiated genetic testing for mutations in the CFTR gene.
Patient: What did the genetic testing find?
Doctor: We detected two mutations, F508del and R117H-7T. Pulmonary function testing revealed a severe obstructive ventilation disorder with a forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) of 27% predicted and respiratory failure with the need for oxygen therapy.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What about liver or pancreas involvement?
Doctor: We didn't find any indications of liver or pancreas involvement in the context of the underlying disease. The repeatedly determined pancreatic elastase was in the normal range, greater than 200 μg/g.
Patient: I see. I've been having a productive cough and recurrent pulmonary infections, too.
Doctor: In your sputum samples, P. aeruginosa was cultured several times. Serologically, antibodies (Elastase and Exotoxin A) against P. aeruginosa were significantly increased, indicating chronic respiratory tract infection.
Patient: I've had a long history of shortness of breath, productive cough, and recurrent pulmonary infections. I've been on frequent antibiotic therapies.
Doctor: I understand. You mentioned using bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for many years, thinking you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). You haven't smoked or been exposed to occupational hazards, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. I've also been treated with systemic corticosteroids in the past due to severe obstructive pulmonary disease.
Doctor: Besides pulmonary involvement, you also have a long-standing affection of the paranasal sinuses. Because of the chronic infection with P. aeruginosa, we are initiating an inhalative antibiotic therapy with tobramycin, 300 mg twice a day.
Patient: Okay, and what if the tobramycin doesn't work?
Doctor: If we see an increase in bronchial obstruction, we can change the antibiotic therapy to colistin, 2 MIU twice a day.

Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What do we do now?
Doctor: We performed an open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture the following day. You were under general anesthesia and in the lateral position during the procedure. We approached your elbow posteriorly and used a 1.6-mm K-wire to hold the radial head in place. The olecranon was reduced under direct vision and held with a tension band using two 1.6-mm K-wires.
Patient: I see. So, what happened after the surgery?
Doctor: Postoperatively, we protected your elbow using an above-elbow slab for three weeks. After that, we started both active and passive range of motion exercises.
Patient: And how did my elbow heal after that?
Doctor: The fracture healed uneventfully, and within six weeks of fixation, you had a complete range of motion of 30-130 degrees at the elbow joint.
Patient: That's great to hear! Did anything else need to be done?
Doctor: Yes, we removed the implant after six months. You are now completely asymptomatic with a full range of flexion, extension, supination, and pronation, along with evidence of bony union.

What do we do now?\nDoctor: We performed an open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture the following day. You were under general anesthesia and in the lateral position during the procedure. We approached your elbow posteriorly and used a 1.6-mm K-wire to hold the radial head in place. The olecranon was reduced under direct vision and held with a tension band using two 1.6-mm K-wires.\nPatient: I see. So, what happened after the surgery?\nDoctor: Postoperatively, we protected your elbow using an above-elbow slab for three weeks. After that, we started both active and passive range of motion exercises.\nPatient: And how did my elbow heal after that?\nDoctor: The fracture healed uneventfully, and within six weeks of fixation, you had a complete range of motion of 30-130 degrees at the elbow joint.\nPatient: That's great to hear! Did anything else need to be done?\nDoctor: Yes, we removed the implant after six months.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having a fever and a headache for about a month now, and I've been vomiting too.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me ask you a few questions to better understand your situation. Have you been evaluated for immune-suppressed states like diabetes mellitus, AIDS, and hepatitis B and C virus infections?
Patient: Yes, I've been tested for all of those, and the results came back negative.
Doctor: Okay, that's good to know. Based on your symptoms of fever and headache, I'm considering a provisional diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. I'll order a CT brain scan with contrast to further investigate your condition.
Patient: Alright, thank you.
Doctor: The CT brain scan with contrast has shown multiple ring-enhancing lesions. We also performed an MRI brain spectroscopy, which revealed ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding oedema. These lesions are reported to be tuberculomas based on the imaging findings and MRI spectroscopy findings.
Patient: Oh! What does that mean?
Doctor: Tuberculomas are masses that can develop in the brain due to a tuberculosis infection. To further investigate, we performed a CT thorax scan with administration of intravenous contrast. The scan showed consolidation with cavitation in your left upper lobe and fibrosing mediastinitis. There was also soft tissue extension along the left hilum, narrowing the left pulmonary vessels and left bronchus. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were seen as well.
Patient: That sounds serious. What's the next step?
Doctor: Given the brain lesions and lung findings, we suspected tuberculosis. So, we performed a CT-guided biopsy of the thick-walled cavity. The histopathological and microbiological findings showed features of cryptococcus pneumonia.
Patient: What does that mean for my treatment?
Doctor: We've started you on antifungal therapy to treat the cryptococcus pneumonia. This should help you improve symptomatically.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything. I'm glad we found out what's causing my symptoms.

"Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having some health issues, and I was diagnosed with CVID not long ago.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your symptoms and medical history?
Patient: Sure. I had autoimmune hepatitis, but the markers were false negative due to my immunodeficiency. I also had a biopsy from my duodenum that showed celiac-like disease. I was on immunosuppressant drugs before my definite diagnosis. My genetic results showed that I have an NF-κB2 frameshift mutation.
Doctor: That must have been difficult for you. Were there any other issues in your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I've had a history of recurrent colds, hospitalization for pneumocystis jiroveci, atopy, and allergy. My Immunoglobulin levels were as follows: IgG = 7.05 g/L, IgM = 0.3 g/L, IgA = 0.5 g/L, and IgE = 2 g/L.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It looks like your flow cytometry results demonstrated CD4 = 59%, CD8 = 14%, and CD16 + 56 = 14%. Were you started on IVIg therapy?
Patient: Yes, but I had an allergic reaction to it, so it was discontinued. I was reluctant to take it again.
Doctor: I understand. So, you went back to using immunosuppressive drugs like cellcept and prednisone, is that correct?
Patient: That's right. But then I became pregnant and stopped taking all the medications. Strangely, my liver enzymes became normal, with AST = 20 and ALT = 32.
Doctor: That's interesting. How was your pregnancy? Did you experience any complications?
Patient: I developed eclampsia at 24 weeks, but it was handled under the supervision of my obstetrician. I also had tachypnea and dyspnea at 30 weeks and was suspicious for PTE, so I received heparin for a month.
Doctor: It seems like you went through a lot during your pregnancy. What were your immunoglobulin levels at 34 weeks of gestation?
Patient: My IgG was 5.1 g/L, IgM was 0.42 g/L, and IgA was 0.49 g/L.
Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. It's great to hear that you had your baby at 38 weeks. How is your baby doing?
Patient: The baby is doing well, thankfully.

Her immunoglobulin levels were low, and she reported normalization of liver enzymes during pregnancy.\nO: The patient's immunoglobulin levels were IgG = 7.05 g/L, IgM = 0.3 g/L, IgA = 0.5 g/L, and IgE = 2 g/L before pregnancy. During pregnancy, levels were IgG = 5.1 g/L, IgM = 0.42 g/L, and IgA = 0.49 g/L. Liver enzymes normalized during pregnancy with AST = 20 and ALT = 32. Flow cytometry results showed CD4 = 59%, CD8 = 14%, and CD16 + 56 = 14%. She was treated with heparin for suspected PTE.\nA: Primary diagnosis is Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) with complications including autoimmune hepatitis, celiac-like disease, and eclampsia. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of primary immunodeficiency. The patient's history of allergic reaction to IVIg and complications during pregnancy are significant for management.\nP: Management will continue with monitoring of immunoglobulin levels and liver enzymes. Consideration for alternative immunoglobulin replacement therapy should be explored due to previous allergic reaction. Close follow-up with a gastroenterologist for celiac-like disease and a hepatologist for liver function is recommended. Genetic counseling may be beneficial given the NF-κB2 mutation. Obstetric follow-up is essential due to past complications, and pediatric evaluation of the baby's immunoglobulin levels and vaccination schedule is necessary.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I came to the emergency room because I noticed some left-sided facial weakness while I was brushing my teeth, and my speech is slurred too.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any eye pain, tearing, redness, hearing loss, difficulty swallowing, or weakness or numbness in your extremities?
Patient: No, none of those symptoms.
Doctor: Alright, are you able to understand and express words without any difficulty?
Patient: Yes, I can.
Doctor: Have you had any headache, gait problems, falls, or recent illness? Do you have a prior history of stroke or seizures?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those.
Doctor: What about your past medical history? Do you have any existing conditions?
Patient: Yeah, I have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and multiple myeloma.
Doctor: Are you currently on any medications for those conditions?
Patient: Yes, I'm on chemotherapy with ixazomib, acyclovir prophylaxis, and a daily aspirin.

Doctor: Your vital signs are unremarkable, but the examination showed lower facial muscle weakness with no difficulty in closing your left eye. Your National Institutes of Health stroke scale is two for facial weakness and dysarthria. We'll need to do some blood work to further investigate.
[After blood work]
Doctor: Your blood work shows mild anemia and normal serum calcium. Your coagulation workup is unremarkable as well. We'll need to perform a non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) of your head to get a better understanding of what's happening.
[After CT]
Doctor: The CT results show acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal region with global cerebral atrophy. We'll also perform a CT angiogram of your head and neck to further investigate.
[After CT angiogram]
Doctor: The CT angiogram results are unremarkable. However, on the second day, you were unable to close your left eye with Bell's phenomenon. We're considering a few potential causes for your symptoms. It could be lower motor neuron facial palsy from multiple myeloma or diabetes mellitus, or a focal seizure from acute right parietal intracerebral hemorrhage. We'll need to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain to help us identify the cause.
[After MRI]
Doctor: The MRI results show hyperintensity in T1-weighted sequence, no significant post-contrast enhancement, blooming artifact in the susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), and hyperintensity in T2-weighted fluid attenuation and inversion recovery. We'll review these findings and come up with a treatment plan as soon as possible.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you were hospitalized recently due to a motorcycle crash. Can you tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yeah, I suffered some blunt chest and abdominal trauma, and I also had a concussion, but I didn't lose consciousness.
Doctor: I see. It's good to know that you were conscious. Your Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15, which means you were alert and responsive. You were also hemodynamically stable when you arrived at the hospital.
Patient: That's a relief to hear. How did my abdomen feel when I got here?
Doctor: Your abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender to palpation with no guarding. That's a good sign. We also conducted some lab tests to check your blood levels.
Patient: What were the results of the lab tests?
Doctor: Your labs were significant for a hemoglobin count of 14.2 g/dL, which is within the normal range of 13.5–17.5 g/dL. Your white blood count was 11.8 1000/μL, slightly higher than the normal range of 4.5–11 1000/μL, and your lactate level was 1.7 mmol/L, which is also within the normal range of 0.7–2.1 mmol/L. These levels remained stable throughout your hospital course.
Patient: Okay, so what happened next?
Doctor: We performed an initial intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis 10 minutes after you arrived. The CT scan was interpreted by a radiology resident 15 minutes later, and a board-certified emergency radiologist completed the final interpretation in an additional 1 hour and 25 minutes.
Patient: What did the CT scan show?
Doctor: The initial CT interpretation indicated nonspecific wall thickening of the proximal jejunum, and occult small bowel injury could not be excluded. Given these findings, we ordered a repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast as per our institution's standard protocol for evaluation of possible occult bowel injury in blunt abdominal trauma.
Patient: When was the follow-up CT performed?
Doctor: The follow-up CT was performed after midnight, 8 hours after the initial CT. It demonstrated trace pneumoperitoneum, possibly originating from the splenic flexure of the colon without evidence of extravasation of oral contrast.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Pneumoperitoneum refers to the presence of air or gas in your abdominal cavity. It can be a sign of an injury in your abdomen. The time from repeat CT scan completion to initial interpretation by a radiology resident was 30 minutes. They made the surgery team aware of these findings immediately.
Patient: Did the emergency radiologist confirm the presence of pneumoperitoneum?
Doctor: Yes, a board-certified emergency radiologist reviewed the study 10 minutes later and provided another preliminary interpretation, confirming the presence of pneumoperitoneum.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: The surgery team will assess your condition based on the presence of pneumoperitoneum in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma. They'll determine the appropriate course of action and discuss it with you. In the meantime, please let us know if you experience any discomfort or worsening symptoms.","S: The patient reports experiencing blunt chest and abdominal trauma and a concussion without loss of consciousness following a motorcycle crash.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 12-year-old boy. Can you tell me what symptoms you've been experiencing recently?
Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling general malaise, drowsiness, appetite loss, nausea, and discomfort in my abdomen. My urine has also been darker than usual for the past two days.
Doctor: I understand. It seems you were admitted to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases at St. George University Hospital in Bulgaria. When you arrived, did they notice any changes in your skin or eyes?
Patient: Yes, they said my skin and conjunctivas were mildly jaundiced.
Doctor: Okay. On admission, were you able to walk and move around normally?
Patient: Yeah, I was ambulatory, and they didn't find any neurological symptoms at first.
Doctor: I see. Did your jaundice worsen, or did you experience any other symptoms after being admitted?
Patient: Yes, the jaundice got worse, and my malaise progressed. I also had abdominal pain, headache, and pain in the muscles of my lower extremities.
Doctor: Were you running a fever, or were you conscious during this time?
Patient: No, I was afebrile and conscious.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. It seems that between the 2nd and 14th day after admission, a neurological examination revealed some issues. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Sure. They found absent Achilles and knee-jerk reflexes, diminished brachioradialis reflex, and absent abdominal and cremasteric reflexes. They also said I had moderately decreased muscle power in my upper extremities and more pronounced power loss in my lower extremities.
Doctor: Did this affect your mobility, like sitting, standing, or moving around independently?
Patient: Yes, I had decreased mobility when lying in bed and was unable to sit, stand, or mobilize independently.
Doctor: How about your sensation? Did you have any changes in your sense of touch?
Patient: They said my deep sensation was preserved, but I had paresthesia in my palms and soles.
Doctor: Did you develop any facial issues, such as facial palsy?
Patient: Yes, I developed facial palsy, House-Brackmann grade V. It was more pronounced on the right side, and Bell's sign was positive bilaterally.
Doctor: How was your mouth movement and swallowing? Did you have any difficulties?
Patient: My mouth movement was insufficient, but I didn't have difficulty swallowing. There was no urine or fecal incontinence either.
Doctor: That's good to know. Were your heart and respiratory rates and peripheral arterial pressure normal?
Patient: Yes, they were all normal.
Doctor: I see that there was an albuminocytologic dissociation in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The pressure and cell count were normal, sugar levels were 3.4 mmol/l, but protein levels were about three times higher than the reference range at 1.52 g/l. So, they initiated treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.400 gm/kg for 5 days. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've been feeling better over the past few days, and things seem to be improving.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Please continue monitoring your symptoms and follow up with your healthcare provider as needed. Let us know if you experience any changes or have any concerns.","S: A 12-year-old boy presents with general malaise, drowsiness, appetite loss, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and darker urine for the past two days. He was admitted to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases with mild jaundice of the skin and conjunctivas. Post-admission, he experienced worsening jaundice, increased malaise, abdominal pain, headache, and muscle pain in the lower extremities. He remained afebrile and conscious throughout.

O: The patient was ambulatory upon admission with no initial neurological symptoms. Neurological findings included absent reflexes, decreased muscle power, and facial palsy. Sensory examination showed preserved deep sensation. Vital signs were normal, including heart and respiratory rates and peripheral arterial pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed albuminocytologic dissociation with normal pressure and cell count, sugar levels at 3.4 mmol/l, and elevated protein levels at 1.52 g/l (normal range: 0.15-0.45 g/l).
A: The primary diagnosis is Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), indicated by progressive muscle weakness, areflexia, facial palsy, and albuminocytologic dissociation in CSF. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of acute flaccid paralysis and neuropathies, but clinical presentation and CSF findings strongly suggest GBS.
P: The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dosage of 0.400 gm/kg for 5 days, which has led to some improvement in symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello Mr. Turner, I've been reviewing your case and I wanted to talk to you about your condition. You are a 65-year-old ambulatory diabetic patient with concomitant mental illness and alcoholism. It seems that you've had some difficulty sticking to your diabetic regime in the past. Can you share more about that?
Patient: Yeah, I had a tough time managing my diabetes. I guess I just didn't take it seriously enough.
Doctor: I understand, Mr. Turner. Over a 21-month period, you had 44 emergency department visits and 27 hospitalizations, with over half of those hospitalizations being in the Intensive Care Unit for diabetic ketoacidosis. It became medically necessary to involve Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) to help you manage your condition better. How have you been feeling since the HBPC visits started?
Patient: Oh, those visits have made a huge difference! I feel much more engaged in my care now, and I'm starting to understand how important it is to manage my diabetes.
Doctor: That's great to hear. I see that the HBPC team consulted behavioral health clinicians to help you with your mental health and alcoholism as well. Are you finding their support helpful?
Patient: Yes, they've been really helpful. I feel like I'm finally getting the support I need to deal with everything going on in my life.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Turner. I also noticed that you got new glasses to help you read your insulin syringes. Has that made a difference in your ability to manage your diabetes?
Patient: Absolutely! I can finally see the markings on the syringes clearly, so I'm more confident in taking the right amount of insulin.
Doctor: That's excellent, Mr. Turner. It seems like after the house calls were initiated, your adherence to your diabetic regime and your overall quality of life dramatically improved. In fact, you've only had one hospitalization over the next two years. How do you feel about your progress?
Patient: I'm really happy with how things are going. It's been a big change, but I feel like I'm finally in control of my health.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Turner. HBPC programs like the one you're participating in are increasing in prevalence across the United States, thanks to health systems promoting value-based care. These programs aim to provide high-quality, compassionate care in the home for patients with the highest level of medical need, while also achieving cost savings.
Patient: That's good to know. It's definitely been a lifesaver for me.
Doctor: Yes, these programs can be quite beneficial. They come in different models, including hospital-based, government-run, and free-standing programs. They often involve an interdisciplinary team approach, and some even have a financial entity that takes on the risk for patient care, which can lead to shared cost-savings as a result of better care.
Patient: Wow, I didn't realize there were so many different types of programs. I'm just grateful I got the help I needed.
Doctor: We're glad to help, Mr. Turner. Just remember to continue following your diabetic regime and the advice of your healthcare team. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all the support I've gotten, and I'll do my best to stay on track with my health.","S: Mr. Turner, a 65-year-old diabetic patient with mental illness and alcoholism, reported difficulty in managing his diabetes due to not taking it seriously. He noted significant improvement in his condition and engagement in care following the initiation of Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) visits. He expressed that the support from behavioral health clinicians was beneficial and that new glasses improved his ability to administer insulin correctly.
O: Mr. Turner has a history of 44 emergency department visits and 27 hospitalizations over 21 months, primarily for diabetic ketoacidosis, with over half of these hospitalizations in the Intensive Care Unit. Since the start of HBPC, his hospitalizations reduced significantly, with only one occurrence over the following two years. 
A: Mr. Turner's primary diagnosis is diabetes mellitus, complicated by mental illness and alcoholism. The introduction of HBPC has led to improved management of his diabetes and overall quality of life. The interdisciplinary approach and additional support for mental health and visual impairment have been crucial in enhancing his adherence to the diabetic regime.
P: Continue the current HBPC program and maintain regular follow-ups to monitor Mr. Turner's diabetes and mental health. Encourage adherence to the diabetic regime and utilization of behavioral health resources. Regularly assess the need for adjustments in care based on his health status and feedback. Educate Mr. Turner on the importance of consistent care management and provide support as needed to address any barriers to compliance.",Create a medical SOAP summary of this dialogue.,"[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert medical professor assisting in the creation of medically accurate SOAP summaries.

How have you been feeling since the HBPC visits started?\nPatient: Oh, those visits have made a huge difference! I feel much more engaged in my care now, and I'm starting to understand how important it is to manage my diabetes.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. I see that the HBPC team consulted behavioral health clinicians to help you with your mental health and alcoholism as well. Are you finding their support helpful?\nPatient: Yes, they've been really helpful. I feel like I'm finally getting the support I need to deal with everything going on in my life.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Turner. I also noticed that you got new glasses to help you read your insulin syringes. Has that made a difference in your ability to manage your diabetes?\nPatient: Absolutely! I can finally see the markings on the syringes clearly, so I'm more confident in taking the right amount of insulin.\nDoctor: That's excellent, Mr. Turner. It seems like after the house calls were initiated, your adherence to your diabetic regime and your overall quality of life dramatically improved. In fact, you've only had one hospitalization over the next two years. How do you feel about your progress?\nPatient: I'm really happy with how things are going. It's been a big change, but I feel like I'm finally in control of my health.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Turner. HBPC programs like the one you're participating in are increasing in prevalence across the United States, thanks to health systems promoting value-based care. These programs aim to provide high-quality, compassionate care in the home for patients with the highest level of medical need, while also achieving cost savings.\nPatient: That's good to know. It's definitely been a lifesaver for me.\nDoctor: Yes, these programs can be quite beneficial. They come in different models, including hospital-based, government-run, and free-standing programs. They often involve an interdisciplinary team approach, and some even have a financial entity that takes on the risk for patient care, which can lead to shared cost-savings as a result of better care.\nPatient: Wow, I didn't realize there were so many different types of programs. I'm just grateful I got the help I needed.\nDoctor: We're glad to help, Mr. Turner. Just remember to continue following your diabetic regime and the advice of your healthcare team. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all the support I've gotten, and I'll do my best to stay on track with my health.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I see you were referred to our department due to a several-week history of right inguinal pain and discomfort in your right femur that worsened with movement. Can you describe the pain and discomfort you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yes, the pain in my right groin area has been bothering me for a few weeks now. It gets worse whenever I move, and I also feel some discomfort in my right thigh.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We conducted laboratory tests, and your white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were normal. We also performed ultrasound and computed tomography examinations, which indicated a vermiform appendix in an inguinal hernia sac. However, there were no remarkable findings of inflammation in the appendix (Fig. a, b).
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's the diagnosis then?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with an Amyand's hernia (AH) without appendicitis. We attempted a reduction of the hernia under ultrasound, but it was unsuccessful. Therefore, we planned a combined totally extraperitoneal (TEP) mesh repair and laparoscopic appendectomy after laparoscopic reduction.
Patient: Hmm, okay. What does that procedure involve?
Doctor: First, you will be placed in a supine position and undergo general anesthesia by tracheal intubation. We will first perform a laparoscopic transabdominal approach after establishing pneumoperitoneum. A 5-mm direct umbilical trocar and a needle forceps (Endo Relief™) will be introduced into the upper right abdominal quadrant to inspect the hernia canal for the absence of appendicitis and reduce the appendix laparoscopically.
Patient: Alright. What happens after that?
Doctor: During the inspection, we found a 3 × 2 cm right external inguinal hernia defect with the appendix, but no other intra-abdominal pathology was identified. We will pull the vermiform appendix out and place it in the abdominal cavity without tearing it. After that, we will reduce the hernia sac into the abdomen via the laparoscopic TEP approach.
Patient: Okay, and then what?
Doctor: You will be placed in a 30° Trendelenburg position. We will lateralize the rectus muscle and insert a Covidien Balloon Dissector preperitoneally from the umbilical incision of the skin to the symphysis pubis. The balloon will be insufflated to open the extraperitoneal area. We will then introduce additional trocars: a 12-mm trocar in the initial umbilical incision of the skin and anterior right fascia of the rectus, and a 5-mm trocar at the symphysis.
Patient: I understand. What can I expect after the surgery?
Doctor: After the surgery, we will monitor your recovery and address any potential complications. It is important for you to follow our post-operative care instructions, which may include pain management, wound care, and activity restrictions.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns during your recovery, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help you every step of the way.","S: The patient reports a several-week history of right inguinal pain and discomfort in the right femur, which worsens with movement.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of jaundice in your skin and sclera, along with epigastric pain for the past two weeks. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. The yellowing and pain have been bothering me a lot.
Doctor: I understand. We've conducted several examinations to determine the cause, including enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT scans, a chest X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound, tumor markers, liver and renal function tests, and coagulation function tests. Let me go over the results with you.
Patient: Okay, please do.
Doctor: The CT scans revealed a low-density mass of 4.0 cm in diameter located in the uncinate process of your pancreas. Additionally, your intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts are obviously dilated, and your pancreatic duct is slightly dilated as well. The non-contrast CT scan showed calcification within the mass, and the contrast CT showed that the enhancement of the tumor is similar to the surrounding normal pancreatic parenchyma. Here's a figure for you to see (Fig.).
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there's a growth in your pancreas that could be contributing to your symptoms. Now, let's go over your laboratory data. Your white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin levels are within the normal ranges. However, your AFP level is elevated at 71.5 ng/mL, while the normal range is less than 8.1 ng/mL.
Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Additionally, your carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is within the normal range at 2.0 ng/mL, but your carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is significantly elevated at 437.2 U/mL, with the normal range being 0-37 U/mL. Your aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are also elevated, at 51 U/L and 151 U/L, respectively.
Patient: Wow, that's quite high.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Furthermore, your total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) levels are also elevated, at 281.2 μmol/L and 212.6 μmol/L, respectively. These results, along with the imaging findings, led us to suspect an incorrect diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm before the operation.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that we initially suspected a specific type of pancreatic tumor, but further examinations and test results may require us to revise our diagnosis. Our team will continue to investigate and determine the appropriate course of action.
Patient: Alright. What's the next step?
Doctor: We will need to perform additional tests and possibly a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Once we have a definitive diagnosis, we can then discuss treatment options and develop a care plan tailored to your specific needs.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thorough explanation.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll keep you informed and work together to address your health concerns. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance.","S: Patient reports a chief complaint of jaundice and epigastric pain persisting for two weeks. The patient expresses significant discomfort from these symptoms.
O: Physical examination shows jaundice in skin and sclera. Enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT scans reveal a 4.0 cm low-density mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas, with calcification and similar enhancement to the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. Intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts and pancreatic duct are dilated. Laboratory results indicate normal white and red blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels. Elevated markers include AFP at 71.5 ng/mL (normal <8.1 ng/mL), CA 19-9 at 437.2 U/mL (normal 0-37 U/mL), AST at 51 U/L, and ALT at 151 U/L. Total bilirubin is 281.2 μmol/L and direct bilirubin is 212.6 μmol/L.
A: The primary assessment is a pancreatic mass with associated jaundice and liver function abnormalities, suggestive of a pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm. Differential diagnosis includes other types of pancreatic tumors or biliary tract disease. Elevated tumor markers and liver enzymes, along with imaging findings, support the likelihood of a neoplastic process.
P: Plan to perform additional diagnostic tests, including a biopsy of the pancreatic mass, to confirm the diagnosis.

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. The yellowing and pain have been bothering me a lot.\nDoctor: I understand. We've conducted several examinations to determine the cause, including enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT scans, a chest X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound, tumor markers, liver and renal function tests, and coagulation function tests. Let me go over the results with you.\nPatient: Okay, please do.\nDoctor: The CT scans revealed a low-density mass of 4.0 cm in diameter located in the uncinate process of your pancreas. Additionally, your intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts are obviously dilated, and your pancreatic duct is slightly dilated as well. The non-contrast CT scan showed calcification within the mass, and the contrast CT showed that the enhancement of the tumor is similar to the surrounding normal pancreatic parenchyma. Here's a figure for you to see (Fig.).\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means there's a growth in your pancreas that could be contributing to your symptoms. Now, let's go over your laboratory data. Your white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin levels are within the normal ranges. However, your AFP level is elevated at 71.5 ng/mL, while the normal range is less than 8.1 ng/mL.\nPatient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Additionally, your carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is within the normal range at 2.0 ng/mL, but your carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is significantly elevated at 437.2 U/mL, with the normal range being 0-37 U/mL. Your aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are also elevated, at 51 U/L and 151 U/L, respectively.\nPatient: Wow, that's quite high.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. Furthermore, your total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) levels are also elevated, at 281.2 μmol/L and 212.6 μmol/L, respectively. These results, along with the imaging findings, led us to suspect an incorrect diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm before the operation.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means that we initially suspected a specific type of pancreatic tumor, but further examinations and test results may require us to revise our diagnosis. Our team will continue to investigate and determine the appropriate course of action.\nPatient: Alright. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We will need to perform additional tests and possibly a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Once we have a definitive diagnosis, we can then discuss treatment options and develop a care plan tailored to your specific needs.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thorough explanation.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll keep you informed and work together to address your health concerns. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance.""}

"Doctor: Hello! I see from your history that you've been dealing with Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL for two years now. Can you tell me about the symptoms that led you to the emergency department back in June 2015?
Patient: Yeah, I had been feeling really tired and lethargic for a couple of weeks. I also had backache, leg, and rib pain that was so bad that even opioids didn't help.
Doctor: I see. Your blood counts at that time showed leukocytosis with a white cell count of 67 × 10^9 cells/l and 34% lymphoblasts measured by flow cytometry. Your hemoglobin was 12.3 g/dl and your platelet count was at 49 × 10^9/l. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy confirmed that you had a precursor B-cell ALL, Ph+ (t 9; 22). You were then enrolled in the UKALL14, version 6 Protocol, which is a five-drug induction regimen designed for adults with de novo ALL between 25 and 65 years. 
Patient: Yeah, I remember that. They gave me a bunch of medications.
Doctor: Yes, during Induction Phase I, you received PEG-ASP (1000 IU/m2) on days 4 and 18, daunorubicin 30 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 on days 1–4, 8–11, 15–18, and intrathecal methotrexate (ITMTX) 12.5 mg on day 14. You were also given continuous imatinib 400 mg, which was later escalated to 600 mg daily throughout your induction treatment.
Patient: That's right. And then I had another round of treatment.
Doctor: Correct. During Phase II induction, you were given cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, Ara-C 75 mg/m2 on days 2–5, 9–12, 16–19, and 23–26, mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 throughout, and intrathecal methotrexate on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
Patient: So, what happened after that?
Doctor: After Phase II induction, you achieved a complete molecular remission with negative BCR-ABL1 p190 transcripts, as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, you did experience some complications, including constipation, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia.
Patient: Yeah, that was a tough time. What came next?
Doctor: To consolidate your remission, you underwent myeloablative conditioning, which included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI). This was followed by a stem cell transplant to help rebuild your immune system and fight off any remaining cancer cells.
Patient: I remember that. It was quite an intense treatment.
Doctor: Yes, it can be. But the good news is that you achieved a complete molecular remission, which is a great outcome. It's important to continue with regular follow-ups and monitoring to ensure that your condition remains stable and any potential complications are addressed promptly.","S: The patient, diagnosed with Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL, reported extreme fatigue, backache, and pain in the legs and ribs, which were unresponsive to opioids, leading to their initial presentation in June 2015.
O: Initial blood counts showed leukocytosis with a white cell count of 67 × 10^9 cells/l, 34% lymphoblasts, hemoglobin at 12.3 g/dl, and platelets at 49 × 10^9/l. Diagnosis was confirmed via bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. During treatment, the patient received a multi-drug regimen including PEG-ASP, daunorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, intrathecal methotrexate, and imatinib, followed by cyclophosphamide, Ara-C, mercaptopurine, and additional intrathecal methotrexate. Complications included constipation, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia. Post-treatment, the patient achieved complete molecular remission confirmed by negative BCR-ABL1 p190 transcripts via RT-PCR.
A: Primary diagnosis is Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL. The patient achieved complete molecular remission following intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. Differential diagnoses during initial presentation could have included other forms of leukemia or hematologic disorders. Prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the current remission status, but vigilant monitoring for relapse or secondary complications is necessary.
P: The patient will continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any signs of relapse or complications. Ongoing supportive care for post-transplant recovery and management of any long-term side effects from chemotherapy is essential. Education on signs of potential relapse and when to seek immediate care will be provided.

Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: On presentation, your vitals showed a blood pressure of 77/35 mmHg, heart rate of 122 bpm, respiratory rate of 38 bpm, a temperature of 102 F, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 15 L of oxygen. We also noted that you were diaphoretic, with decreased breath sounds in the right lung field, and on palpation of your abdomen, there was right upper quadrant fullness.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Your initial laboratory studies showed elevated white blood cells at 22.6 × 109/L with neutrophilia, bicarbonate at 21 mmol/L, lactic acid at 6.5 mmol/L, anion gap at 17, ALT at 71 IU/L, AST at 69 IU/L, and ALP at 450 IU/L. Your ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Your CXR showed an acute right pleural effusion.
Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Due to your respiratory failure, we had to intubate you. We also started you on antibiotics - piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin - and intravenous normal saline. However, there was no improvement in your blood pressure, so we had to start you on intravenous vasopressor support with norepinephrine and vasopressin. You were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Because of the right upper quadrant fullness, elevated liver enzymes, and fever, we performed an abdominal ultrasound, which showed an acute complex heterogeneous hypoechoic mass-like lesion in your right hepatic lobe, measuring 8 × 7 × 6 cm.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: To better understand the lesion, we did a CT scan of your abdomen. The CT showed a complex low-density right hepatic lobe subcapsular lesion measuring 13 × 8 × 7 cm, directly abutting the right anterior diaphragm. We also found diffuse gross gallbladder wall thickening with cholelithiasis and a moderate right pleural effusion.

Can you tell me about them?\nPatient: Yeah, for the past 2 weeks, I've had a productive cough, fever, shortness of breath, and I've been feeling really weak and tired.\nDoctor: I see. Let's go over your past medical history. You have coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and obstructive sleep apnea, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: On presentation, your vitals showed a blood pressure of 77/35 mmHg, heart rate of 122 bpm, respiratory rate of 38 bpm, a temperature of 102 F, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 15 L of oxygen. We also noted that you were diaphoretic, with decreased breath sounds in the right lung field, and on palpation of your abdomen, there was right upper quadrant fullness.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: Your initial laboratory studies showed elevated white blood cells at 22.6 × 109/L with neutrophilia, bicarbonate at 21 mmol/L, lactic acid at 6.5 mmol/L, anion gap at 17, ALT at 71 IU/L, AST at 69 IU/L, and ALP at 450 IU/L. Your ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Your CXR showed an acute right pleural effusion.\nPatient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Due to your respiratory failure, we had to intubate you. We also started you on antibiotics - piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin - and intravenous normal saline. However, there was no improvement in your blood pressure, so we had to start you on intravenous vasopressor support with norepinephrine and vasopressin. You were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Because of the right upper quadrant fullness, elevated liver enzymes, and fever, we performed an abdominal ultrasound, which showed an acute complex heterogeneous hypoechoic mass-like lesion in your right hepatic lobe, measuring 8 × 7 × 6 cm.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: To better understand the lesion, we did a CT scan of your abdomen.

"Doctor: Hello, S.B. I see that you were prescribed rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation in the past. Can you tell me more about why you stopped the treatment?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I stopped taking rivaroxaban because I saw some television advertisements that raised concerns about the risks.
Doctor: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, several months after stopping rivaroxaban therapy, you suffered an ischemic cerebral vascular accident (CVA) which converted to a hemorrhagic stroke 2 days later. That happened 2 years ago, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It was a difficult time for me and my family.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. These events resulted in left hemiplegia, which I can see from your medical report. Now, you've been taking warfarin for your atrial fibrillation and have been monitored at your local anticoagulation clinic for about a year, correct?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I've been going there for regular checkups and they monitor my international normalized ratio (INR) levels.
Doctor: That's good to hear. It seems that during your year of warfarin therapy, you reported regularly to the anticoagulation clinic for INR monitoring, with 5- to 8-week follow-up intervals. Most of the time, your INR remained within the prescribed therapeutic range of 2-3. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I also see that you've been suffering from numerous sequelae related to your CVA, and you decided to pursue hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to improve your clinical status and quality of life. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I wanted to try something that might help me feel better and improve my quality of life.
Doctor: I understand. Now, prior to starting your HBOT, you went to the anticoagulation clinic for a regular follow-up, and it was determined that your INR was elevated at 3.5. During the discussion, your son, who is also your caregiver, mentioned that you would be undergoing 1-hour HBOT sessions, five times a week, for a total duration of 6 weeks. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. We've been traveling a long distance to get to the treatment site, and we didn't want to alter the warfarin dose at that time.
Doctor: It's important to consider the increased risk of bleeding events when your INR is out of range. I see that your next INR reading was slightly out of range at 3.2, and no dose change was made. At that time, you were 3 weeks into your HBOT treatment plan without any bleeding complications noted. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, so far I haven't had any complications from the treatment.
Doctor: That's good to hear. It's important to continue monitoring your INR closely and discussing any concerns with your healthcare provider. If you ever have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Doctor: I see. Let's run some tests to find out what's causing these symptoms. 
(After running tests)
Doctor: Based on the test results, you have been diagnosed with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (T2N0M0). To treat this, you will need to undergo a left hemicolectomy, colocolic, and jejunojejunal anastomosis.

Doctor: Your surgery went well, but unfortunately, seven days postoperatively, you developed an anastomotic leak. We had to reoperate to fix the issue.
Patient: Oh no, that's not good. What's next, Doctor?
Doctor: After the second surgery, you were moved to the ICU. On day 2, your condition worsened, and you required high-dose vasopressor. We also had to put you on mechanical ventilation for pulmonary edema.
Patient: Hmm, so what did the echocardiography show?
Doctor: The 2D-echocardiography revealed severely depressed left ventricular function. The findings include global hypokinesia in the anteroseptal wall, anterior wall, and intraventricular septum. Your left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 15-20%. There's also mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and no pulmonary artery hypertension. The intra-ventricular and intra-atrial septum are intact, and there's no pericardial effusion, clot, or vegetation seen.
Patient: What about the ECG results?
Doctor: The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 150 bpm, poor R wave progression, and nonspecific ST-T changes. Your Troponin I level is 1.69 ng/mL, CPK-MB is 5.2 ng/mL, and BNP is 2000 pg/mL.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: We considered the possibility of acute coronary syndrome as a differential, but septic myocarditis is more strongly suspected. 
Patient: What's the treatment plan then?
Doctor: We've started you on daily aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, injection fondaparinux 2.5 mg, and injection torsemide 20 mg thrice daily. 
Patient: I understand. What happened on day 3?
Doctor: On day 3, your hypotension and metabolic acidosis worsened despite high dosages of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dobutamine, as well as a stress dose of hydrocortisone. Your tachycardia was bothersome, and you had chilled peripheries and seemed to be maximally vasoconstricted. Your urine output started falling, so we escalated your antibiotics according to pus culture sensitivity reports.
Patient: Is there anything else that needs to be done?
Doctor: Considering cardiogenic shock as the primary cause of your condition, we've planned to put in an IABP, without wasting any more time.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: A 19-year-old Indian male presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

I've been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss lately.\nDoctor: I see. Let's run some tests to find out what's causing these symptoms. \n(After running tests)\nDoctor: Based on the test results, you have been diagnosed with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (T2N0M0). To treat this, you will need to undergo a left hemicolectomy, colocolic, and jejunojejunal anastomosis.\nPatient: Okay, Doctor. I trust your judgment.\n(After the surgery)\nDoctor: Your surgery went well, but unfortunately, seven days postoperatively, you developed an anastomotic leak. We had to reoperate to fix the issue.\nPatient: Oh no, that's not good. What's next, Doctor?\nDoctor: After the second surgery, you were moved to the ICU. On day 2, your condition worsened, and you required high-dose vasopressor. We also had to put you on mechanical ventilation for pulmonary edema.\nPatient: Hmm, so what did the echocardiography show?\nDoctor: The 2D-echocardiography revealed severely depressed left ventricular function. The findings include global hypokinesia in the anteroseptal wall, anterior wall, and intraventricular septum. Your left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 15-20%. There's also mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and no pulmonary artery hypertension. The intra-ventricular and intra-atrial septum are intact, and there's no pericardial effusion, clot, or vegetation seen.\nPatient: What about the ECG results?\nDoctor: The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 150 bpm, poor R wave progression, and nonspecific ST-T changes. Your Troponin I level is 1.69 ng/mL, CPK-MB is 5.2 ng/mL, and BNP is 2000 pg/mL.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We considered the possibility of acute coronary syndrome as a differential, but septic myocarditis is more strongly suspected. \nPatient: What's the treatment plan then?\nDoctor: We've started you on daily aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, injection fondaparinux 2.5 mg, and injection torsemide 20 mg thrice daily. \nPatient: I understand. What happened on day 3?\nDoctor: On day 3, your hypotension and metabolic acidosis worsened despite high dosages of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dobutamine, as well as a stress dose of hydrocortisone. Your tachycardia was bothersome, and you had chilled peripheries and seemed to be maximally vasoconstricted. Your urine output started falling, so we escalated your antibiotics according to pus culture sensitivity reports.\nPatient: Is there anything else that needs to be done?\nDoctor: Considering cardiogenic shock as the primary cause of your condition, we've planned to put in an IABP, without wasting any more time.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.""}

"Doctor: Good morning. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing some difficulty swallowing and pain when swallowing for about two months now. I also feel like solid foods are getting stuck in my neck.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any choking or gagging?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Alright. Have you had any tests or treatments for this issue?
Patient: Yes, I had neck ultrasonography at my primary care doctor's office, and they found a 6.1-cm cyst. They thought it was an infection and treated me with antibiotics, but my symptoms didn't improve.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for the information. Have you had any other health problems in the past?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension.
Doctor: Do you have any other complaints or any history of immunosuppressive disorders like HIV/AIDS, celiac disease, or inflammatory bowel disease?
Patient: No, I don't. And I haven't had any nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, or weight loss either.
Doctor: Good to know. What about your family history? Is there any history of cancer?
Patient: No, my family history is negative for cancer.
Doctor: Thank you. I'd like to perform a physical examination now. *After the examination* I found a large, tender, and palpable neck mass. We'll need to run some laboratory tests and imaging studies to investigate further.
*After receiving test results*
Doctor: Your laboratory studies, including hematology, serum biochemistry, and urine analysis, are all within normal limits. However, the computed tomography (CT) scan of your head and neck showed a 7.3 × 3.1 × 6.6-cm mass in your neck, which is inseparable from your cervical esophagus. There is no apparent bone compression.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed a barium esophagogram which showed an intact esophageal mucosa, but there is marked narrowing of the cervical part of your esophagus. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed the tumor-related esophageal luminal narrowing. We performed an EUS-guided FNA, but it came back inconclusive.
Patient: So, what do we do now?
Doctor: Our interventional radiology team performed a biopsy of the neck mass. The histopathologic analysis showed malignant lymphocytes with moderately abundant cytoplasm and round-to-ovoid nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical examination was positive for CD20 and CD10 antibodies, and staining was diffusely positive for BCL6 antibody.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with primary esophageal lymphoma. We will need to discuss your treatment options and create a plan moving forward.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a known hypertensive, reports difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing for two months, with sensations of solid foods getting stuck in the neck.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you have a history of alcohol abuse, and you've presented to the gastroenterology department. What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, I've been suffering from severe epigastric pain and nausea for the past two days.
Doctor: I see. Based on your symptoms and your history, I would like to run some laboratory tests to see if there might be any issue with your pancreas. The findings may help us determine if you have pancreatitis or not.
Patient: Okay, that makes sense.
[After the tests]
Doctor: Your laboratory findings were suspicious for pancreatitis, so we decided to proceed with a computed tomography (CT) examination. The CT scan showed an edematous pancreas tail and fluid in the anterior prerenal space as well as in the anterior, posterior, and lateroconal fascia. There were no signs of chronic pancreatitis or vascular complications, but you did have two similar episodes of acute tail pancreatitis in the following months.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: In September 2009, you presented with vague epigastric pain lasting several weeks. Your serum amylase and lipase levels were normal, but your cholestatic parameters were mildly elevated. We performed a magnetic resonance (MR) study, which demonstrated moderate chronic pancreatitis of the tail with atrophy and irregular bordering of the Wirsung's duct. No other abnormalities were found, but further examinations revealed a Helicobacter pylori gastritis.
Patient: Hmm, that's concerning.
Doctor: In February 2012, you presented again to the gastroenterologist with epigastric and left upper quadrant pain. Your laboratory findings were not suspect for acute pancreatitis. However, we performed a contrast-enhanced CT scan to evaluate the known chronic pancreatitis and other potential causes of your pain.
Patient: And what did the scan find?
Doctor: The CT scan revealed a hypervascular lesion in the pancreatic tail, consisting of a conglomeration of small hypervascular spots and blood vessels. We needed to differentiate between a vascular malformation and a hypervascular pancreatic tumor, such as an islet cell tumor or a hypervascular metastasis.
Patient: How did you do that?
Doctor: We performed a contrast-enhanced MR study which showed a focal area of heterogeneous contrast enhancement without an apparent nodular component. The subsequent angiography revealed two large feeding arteries in the early arterial phase, followed by a racemose vascular network, an early transient dense parenchyma stain in the early portal phase, and early wash-out of the lesion in the portal phase.
Doctor: Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation.
Patient: What does that mean for me, and what do I need to do now?
Doctor: It means that there is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in your pancreas. We will need to monitor your condition closely and discuss potential treatment options with you. Please make sure to follow up with us regularly to ensure proper care and management.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll make sure to follow up with you as instructed.","S: The patient, with a history of alcohol abuse, presents with severe epigastric pain and nausea persisting for two days. He has a past medical history of similar episodes and has been previously diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and Helicobacter pylori gastritis.
O: Current laboratory tests raised suspicions of pancreatitis. A CT scan revealed an edematous pancreas tail and fluid in the anterior prerenal space and surrounding fascia, with no signs of chronic changes or vascular complications. Previous imaging and tests in 2009 and 2012 showed chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation, respectively.
A: The primary diagnosis is acute pancreatitis, likely related to the patient's history of alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatic conditions.

"Doctor: Good morning, I'm Dr. Smith. I heard you were brought to the emergency department by ambulance yesterday due to altered mental status. Can you tell me what happened?
Patient: Hi, Dr. Smith. My mother found me in my apartment yesterday feeling very confused and lethargic. She called emergency services because she was worried about me.
Doctor: I see. According to your mother, you mentioned taking a large amount of ibuprofen in a suicide attempt earlier that day. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I took around 300 tablets of 200 mg ibuprofen, so it must have been around 60,000 mg in total.
Doctor: That's a very high dose. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
Patient: No, I don't have any allergies to medications.
Doctor: I understand you have a medical history of depression, asthma, alcohol abuse, and prior drug abuse, including cocaine, Percocet, and intravenous heroin. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. I completed a drug rehabilitation program six months ago and haven't been using illegal drugs since then. I still smoke half a pack of cigarettes a day and occasionally drink alcohol with friends.
Doctor: It's good to hear you've been staying away from illegal drugs. I also see that you have a surgical history of breast reduction surgery. Now, let's talk about your family's medical history. Your father has hypertension, your mother has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and your aunt has cryptogenic cirrhosis, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: When you were brought in, your vital signs were temperature 98 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 111 beats per minute, blood pressure 109/66 mmHg, respiratory rate 17, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Your physical exam showed lethargy, but nothing else significant. Your initial complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) were within normal limits. 
Patient: Okay, so what happened after that?
Doctor: To protect your airway, you were intubated and admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further treatment. Due to the ibuprofen overdose, you were emergently hemodialyzed overnight.
Patient: So, what's the plan moving forward?
Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and provide any necessary treatments. It's crucial that you follow up with your primary care physician and mental health provider to ensure proper care and support.
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate all the help.","S: The patient, a known case of depression, asthma, alcohol, and prior drug abuse, was found by his mother feeling confused and lethargic.

"Doctor: Hello! I see you have a history of age-related macular degeneration. What brings you to the clinic today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was told to come in for a routine dilated fundus exam.
Doctor: Alright, let's start by checking your visual acuity. Your Snellen visual acuity is 20/100 OD in your right eye and count fingers OS in your left eye. I'll now perform the exam.
Patient: Okay, Doctor.
Doctor: I'm noticing some concerning findings. There is end-stage AMD in your left eye and subretinal hemorrhage in your right eye. I think we should refer you for an ocular ultrasound.
Patient: Hmm, alright.
*After the ocular ultrasound*
Doctor: The results show that you have subretinal hemorrhage in your right eye, secondary to progression of your macular degeneration. We will initiate Anti-VEGF treatment and continue it for several months.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
*After several months*
Doctor: Your recent tests show a choroidal lesion measuring 14.5 × 14.6 mm in basal dimension with a thickness of 6.4 mm. There is low to medium reflectivity, moderate irregularity, and trace spontaneous vascularity. These findings are consistent with a clinical diagnosis of choroidal melanoma.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We need to do a liver ultrasound to check for any lesions and further evaluate your condition.
*After liver ultrasound*
Doctor: The liver ultrasound showed questionable focal lesions, so we'll need a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis for further evaluation.
Patient: Alright, let's do it.
*After CT scan and ocular re-evaluation*
Doctor: The staging CT scan and ocular ultrasound (Fig.) were negative for metastatic disease and extrascleral extension. However, an MRI of the orbits with contrast showed a subcentimeter region of abnormal contrast enhancement extending into the adjacent retro-bulbar fat, which is suspicious for scleral invasion and small extrascleral lesional extension (Fig.).
Patient: So, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means there's a possibility of the melanoma spreading beyond the eye, but we'll need to monitor it closely.
*Several days later*
Patient: Doctor, I've been having complaints of right eye pain. It feels like a monotonous friction-like pain.
Doctor: Let's examine your eye. Your visual acuity is now no light perception (NLP) OD in your right eye, and your intraocular pressure is 28 OD. There is diffuse hemorrhage in the anterior chamber and no view into the posterior pole due to vitreous hemorrhage. We'll need to perform a B-scan ocular ultrasound during this visit.
*After B-scan ocular ultrasound*
Doctor: The B-scan results show hemorrhagic choroidal detachment. We'll need to discuss further treatment options and monitor your condition closely.
Patient: Okay, thank you for your help, Doctor.","S: The patient, with a history of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), presented for a routine dilated fundus exam. He reported right eye pain described as a monotonous friction-like sensation. Previously, visual acuity was 20/100 OD and count fingers OS, with subsequent deterioration to no light perception (NLP) OD.
O: Initial examination revealed end-stage AMD OS and subretinal hemorrhage OD. Ocular ultrasound confirmed subretinal hemorrhage OD secondary to AMD progression. Follow-up tests identified a choroidal lesion in the right eye, measuring 14.5 × 14.6 mm with a thickness of 6.4 mm, showing characteristics of choroidal melanoma.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I am a 26-year-old primigravida and I am 23 weeks pregnant. I have a distension in my abdomen that's worrying me.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Yes, two years ago, I had a left salpingo-oopherectomy for an ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma. I received six cycles of combined chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel afterward and was advised to use contraception. I didn't follow up after that, and now I am pregnant.
Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Let's do an abdomen examination to check for any issues. *After examining the patient* It appears that there is some ascites and your uterus is about the size of a 24 weeks pregnancy with palpable fetal parts. We should also do an ultrasound examination to investigate further.
Patient: Okay, what did you find in the ultrasound?
Doctor: The ultrasound shows an intra-uterine pregnancy of 23 weeks and a right ovarian mass of 12.8 x 8.8 cm with solid and cystic areas containing free fluid with internal echoes. Your CA-125 level is also elevated at 80 IU/ml. Based on these findings, it seems like you have recurrent ovarian cancer during your pregnancy.
Patient: Oh no, what are my options?
Doctor: Ideally, we would recommend surgical management to address the cancer. However, I understand that you declined this option. Instead, we started you on two courses of chemotherapy with a single dose of carboplatin 450mg intravenously at three-week intervals.
Patient: Yes, I remember that. But I couldn't do the third course because my liver function tests were not good.
Doctor: That's correct. Unfortunately, the ascites has been progressive, which has led to maternal respiratory distress and fetal growth restriction and oligohydroamnios. We have decided to plan an elective Cesarean section with staging laparotomy at 34 weeks for the breech presentation with decreased liquor and gross ascites, after completion of steroid cover.
Patient: What will happen during the surgery?
Doctor: Intraoperatively, we will drain the hemorrhagic ascetic fluid, which could be around 20 liters. We will also examine the omentum, which appears to be agglutinated over the intestine with deposits present over the uterus. The right ovary has been replaced by a 15x15 cm tumor with rupture and hemorrhage.
Patient: Will my baby be okay?
Doctor: We will do our best to ensure a safe delivery. Your healthy baby girl was born weighing 2.3 kg with APGAR scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The placenta appeared normal at the time of delivery.
Patient: What else was done during the surgery?
Doctor: We performed a total abdominal hysterectomy with right salpingo-oopherectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and appendectomy. Peritoneal washings were collected and multiple peritoneal biopsies were taken for further evaluation.
Patient: I see. What should I expect in terms of follow-up care?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your recovery and the results of the biopsies. Additionally, regular check-ups and imaging will be needed to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and to watch for any signs of recurrence. It is important to follow up with your healthcare team and stay proactive in your care.","S: The patient is a 26-year-old primigravida at 23 weeks gestation, presenting with abdominal distension. She has a history of left salpingo-oophorectomy for ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma and subsequent chemotherapy.

I have a distension in my abdomen that's worrying me.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\nPatient: Yes, two years ago, I had a left salpingo-oopherectomy for an ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma. I received six cycles of combined chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel afterward and was advised to use contraception. I didn't follow up after that, and now I am pregnant.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing that information. Let's do an abdomen examination to check for any issues. *After examining the patient* It appears that there is some ascites and your uterus is about the size of a 24 weeks pregnancy with palpable fetal parts. We should also do an ultrasound examination to investigate further.\nPatient: Okay, what did you find in the ultrasound?\nDoctor: The ultrasound shows an intra-uterine pregnancy of 23 weeks and a right ovarian mass of 12.8 x 8.8 cm with solid and cystic areas containing free fluid with internal echoes. Your CA-125 level is also elevated at 80 IU/ml. Based on these findings, it seems like you have recurrent ovarian cancer during your pregnancy.\nPatient: Oh no, what are my options?\nDoctor: Ideally, we would recommend surgical management to address the cancer. However, I understand that you declined this option. Instead, we started you on two courses of chemotherapy with a single dose of carboplatin 450mg intravenously at three-week intervals.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. But I couldn't do the third course because my liver function tests were not good.\nDoctor: That's correct. Unfortunately, the ascites has been progressive, which has led to maternal respiratory distress and fetal growth restriction and oligohydroamnios. We have decided to plan an elective Cesarean section with staging laparotomy at 34 weeks for the breech presentation with decreased liquor and gross ascites, after completion of steroid cover.\nPatient: What will happen during the surgery?\nDoctor: Intraoperatively, we will drain the hemorrhagic ascetic fluid, which could be around 20 liters. We will also examine the omentum, which appears to be agglutinated over the intestine with deposits present over the uterus. The right ovary has been replaced by a 15x15 cm tumor with rupture and hemorrhage.\nPatient: Will my baby be okay?\nDoctor: We will do our best to ensure a safe delivery. Your healthy baby girl was born weighing 2.3 kg with APGAR scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The placenta appeared normal at the time of delivery.\nPatient: What else was done during the surgery?\nDoctor: We performed a total abdominal hysterectomy with right salpingo-oopherectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and appendectomy. Peritoneal washings were collected and multiple peritoneal biopsies were taken for further evaluation.\nPatient: I see. What should I expect in terms of follow-up care?\nDoctor: We will closely monitor your recovery and the results of the biopsies. Additionally, regular check-ups and imaging will be needed to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and to watch for any signs of recurrence.

Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: You were referred to us from the lung cancer screening program. The high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 1.5 cm mixed ground glass opacity (GGO) with a larger solid component in your right middle lobe (RML). Have you experienced any symptoms related to this?
Patient: No, I haven't felt anything unusual.
Doctor: Okay. The nodule increased in size at the follow-up CT scan, so we decided to resect the middle lobe anatomically using subcostal access. You were given general anesthesia with double lumen endotracheal intubation and placed in a lateral decubitus position, at dorsal decubitus 40 degrees. Does that sound familiar?
Patient: Yes, I remember that part.
Doctor: We made a 5 cm oblique incision parallel to the costal arch, and then the subcutaneous tissue and rectus abdominis were dissected along the subcostal margin. We detached the xiphoid process and pericardiophrenic fatty tissue. A subcostal tunnel was bluntly dissected using a finger until the mediastinal pleura was opened at the cardiophrenic angle. We then placed a covidien wound protector (WPLGR914). 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We used a thoracoscopic lens with a 30° angle (Olympus, Melville, NY) to examine the interlobar fissure. Lobectomy was performed as shown in the video [subcostal right middle lobe lobectomy video]. We also carried out a systematic mediastinal lymph nodes dissection, which included stations 2, 4 right paratracheal, 9, 10, 11, 12, and subcarinal lymph nodes.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to the Department of Neurosurgery today. What brings you in?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having this left facial droop and some spasms on the same side.
Doctor: I see. Other than the facial droop and spasm, do you have any relevant past medical or surgical history?
Patient: No, I don't have any other medical or surgical history.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and our examination, it appears you have an unruptured right middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. We will need to admit you to the hospital for a right-sided craniotomy to clip the aneurysm.
Patient: Oh, okay. What does that procedure involve?
Doctor: The procedure is called a pterional craniotomy, and it will be performed under general anesthesia. During the surgery, we will use intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring methods to ensure your safety.
Patient: What does that monitoring involve?
Doctor: We will use median, ulnar, and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in a standard fashion. These methods help us monitor the function of your motor pathways during the surgery. Transcranial motor evoked potential (TCMEP) and direct cortical motor evoked potential (DCMEP) will also be used.
Patient: I see. And what about the stimulation?
Doctor: For TCMEP, we will use a multi-pulse train of six with a pulse width of 50 µsec and an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 ms (500 Hz). The voltage stimulation will be between 100 and 300 volts, controlling for the inhibition of the ""crossover"" response. For DCMEP, the stimulation parameters include a multi-pulse train of five delivered at a constant current of 15 mA with a pulse width of 500 µsec and an ISI of 2 ms (500 Hz).
Patient: Okay, that's a lot of information. What about the monitoring sites?
Doctor: We will use upper and lower extremity muscles as target acquisition sites. Standard intraoperative electromyography (EMG) needle electrodes will be used for TCMEP and DCMEP during the surgery.
Patient: Got it. When do you collect the TCMEP data?
Doctor: TCMEP data will be collected before the incision is made. The stimulus will be delivered and optimized to inhibit a ""crossover"" recording from the ipsilateral hand muscles.
Patient: And what about the electrodes on my scalp?
Doctor: Three sets of stimulation electrodes will be affixed to your scalp using corkscrew needle electrodes. This will provide three channels of motor stimulation to switch between using a TCS 4 constant voltage stimulator unit. This technique allows for better optimization of the TCMEP recordings.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I'm ready to proceed with the surgery.
Doctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to ensure your safety and a successful outcome. We'll keep you and your family informed throughout the process.","S: The patient presents with left facial droop and spasms on the same side. He has no relevant past medical or surgical history.

What does that procedure involve?\nDoctor: The procedure is called a pterional craniotomy, and it will be performed under general anesthesia. During the surgery, we will use intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring methods to ensure your safety.\nPatient: What does that monitoring involve?\nDoctor: We will use median, ulnar, and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in a standard fashion. These methods help us monitor the function of your motor pathways during the surgery. Transcranial motor evoked potential (TCMEP) and direct cortical motor evoked potential (DCMEP) will also be used.\nPatient: I see. And what about the stimulation?\nDoctor: For TCMEP, we will use a multi-pulse train of six with a pulse width of 50 µsec and an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 ms (500 Hz). The voltage stimulation will be between 100 and 300 volts, controlling for the inhibition of the ""crossover"" response. For DCMEP, the stimulation parameters include a multi-pulse train of five delivered at a constant current of 15 mA with a pulse width of 500 µsec and an ISI of 2 ms (500 Hz).\nPatient: Okay, that\'s a lot of information. What about the monitoring sites?\nDoctor: We will use upper and lower extremity muscles as target acquisition sites. Standard intraoperative electromyography (EMG) needle electrodes will be used for TCMEP and DCMEP during the surgery.\nPatient: Got it. When do you collect the TCMEP data?\nDoctor: TCMEP data will be collected before the incision is made. The stimulus will be delivered and optimized to inhibit a ""crossover"" recording from the ipsilateral hand muscles.\nPatient: And what about the electrodes on my scalp?\nDoctor: Three sets of stimulation electrodes will be affixed to your scalp using corkscrew needle electrodes. This will provide three channels of motor stimulation to switch between using a TCS 4 constant voltage stimulator unit. This technique allows for better optimization of the TCMEP recordings.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I\'m ready to proceed with the surgery.\nDoctor: You\'re welcome. We will do our best to ensure your safety and a successful outcome. We\'ll keep you and your family informed throughout the process.'}

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you presented to the Emergency Department in December 2020 with a large ulcerated and necrotic bulging lesion on your forehead. Can you tell me more about how it started and how it has progressed?
Patient: Yes, it started as a small 2 cm bruise-like patch on my forehead about four months before I came to the hospital. Then it rapidly developed into a large purplish plaque after one month and eventually to the current presentation.
Doctor: I see. Ill-defined, dusky erythematous plaques were also observed extending on the parietal and frontal areas of your scalp and face, along with violaceous-darkish nodules. Are you aware of any comorbidities that you have, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, or ischemic encephalopathy?
Patient: Yes, I have all of those conditions.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. During your physical examination, we also found bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Your relatives provided us with photographic documentation of the evolution of your lesion. I understand that the second lockdown in Italy and the fear of SARS-CoV-2 contagion led them to postpone your medical evaluation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: We performed a biopsy from a violaceous nodule on your lesion, which showed a full dermal proliferation of irregular anastomosing vascular channels lined by single or double layers of enlarged endothelial cells. These cells permeated between collagen bundles, causing ""collagen dissection."" The endothelial cells were large and pleomorphic, with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. They were immunoreactive for CD31, CD34, and ERG, with no observed HHV8 expression or MYC overexpression.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Based on these data, we have confirmed the diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the scalp. We also conducted a total body computed tomography (CT) scan that showed cervical lymphadenopathy without brain or visceral metastases. 
Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: While radiotherapy and electrochemotherapy were considered for your treatment, we decided not to perform these due to your advanced age, comorbidities, and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we referred you to palliative care for symptom management and to improve your quality of life.

Patient: Yes, I have hyperlipidemia and I usually suffer from one or two migraines per month.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache, like nausea or vomiting?
Patient: Yes, actually. I've been feeling nauseous and I've vomited three times.
Doctor: I understand. What medications have you taken recently to try to alleviate the pain?
Patient: I took sumatriptan, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen within the past 48 hours, but they didn't help much.

What medications have you taken recently to try to alleviate the pain?\nPatient: I took sumatriptan, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen within the past 48 hours, but they didn't help much.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Let me examine your head. *Examines patient* I noticed some mild bilateral occipital tenderness to palpation, but no neurological deficits or midline tenderness. I recommend we try some additional medications in the ED triage. We'll start with metoclopramide 10 mg and ketorolac 15 mg intravenously. \nPatient: Okay, I hope that helps.\n*60 minutes later*\nDoctor: How are you feeling now? Has the pain improved after receiving the medications?\nPatient: It's a little better, but I still have a lot of head pain. I'd say it's about a 7 out of 10 in severity now.\nDoctor: I see. Let's try a different approach. We're going to administer bilateral GON blocks with a total of one mL of 1% lidocaine to each site. \nPatient: Alright, if you think that will help.\n*15 minutes after the procedure*\nDoctor: How is your pain now, after the GON blocks?\nPatient: It's much better, thank you. I'd say it's about a 3 out of 10 now.\nDoctor: Great, let's continue to monitor your pain. \n*1.5 hours post-procedure*\nDoctor: How are you feeling now? Is the pain still at a 3 out of 10?\nPatient: Yes, it's still at a 3. It's definitely an improvement from before.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. I will schedule a follow-up phone interview for nine days after this emergency department visit to check on your progress. \n*During the follow-up phone interview*\nDoctor: Hi, how has your pain been since your last emergency department visit?\nPatient: My pain resolved over the course of 24 hours, and I haven't had another migraine since then.\nDoctor: That's great news! I'm glad to hear that your pain has resolved. If you experience any more severe headaches in the future, don't hesitate to reach out for help.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you're a 32-year-old female Cameroonian, gravida 4 para 3, and you're currently at 34 weeks of gestation. Can you tell me what brings you to the labour and delivery unit today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've had a severe generalized headache for about 8 hours now and I'm struggling to speak properly. I also have right-sided paralysis and blurred vision. I haven't had any convulsions, though.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any epigastric pain, difficulty breathing, or had any recent trauma or falls?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those.
Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me a bit about your antenatal care for this pregnancy? When did you start and have you had any issues?
Patient: I started antenatal care at 18 weeks, and my booking blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg. I've done four ANCs and all of them were uneventful. My blood pressure was always less than 140/90 mmHg during those visits.
Doctor: What about proteinuria? Were your urine dipsticks tested during the ANCs?
Patient: Yes, my urine dipsticks were tested during the four ANCs and they were all negative for proteinuria.
Doctor: Have you had any neurological symptoms such as headaches during this pregnancy?
Patient: No, I haven't had any headaches during this pregnancy.
Doctor: Do you have any history of gestational hypertension or any family history of chronic hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney diseases?
Patient: I did have gestational hypertension in my third pregnancy, but there's no family history of chronic hypertension, diabetes, or kidney diseases.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Upon examination, you're afebrile with a blood pressure of 182/126 mmHg and a pulse of 112 beats/minute. Your neurological examination revealed a Glasgow coma score of 13/15, right-sided hemiparesis, and expressive Broca's aphasia. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. Your abdomen is distended with a fundal height of 35 cm, and the fetus is in a longitudinal lie with a cephalic presentation. The cervix is long, posterior, soft, and closed with a station of -1. Based on this, our working diagnosis is severe pre-eclampsia complicated by stroke.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What's the next step, Doctor?
Doctor: We performed an emergency obstetric ultrasound, which showed a live fetus with an estimated weight of 2300 g at 33 weeks of gestation. We also did an emergency cerebral non-contrast CT scan that showed a 3.2 cm hyperdense region in the left parietal lobe with surrounding hypodensity due to clot retraction.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there's a clot in your brain causing the stroke symptoms you're experiencing. Our team will proceed with emergency management, which includes administering MgSO4 and monitoring your condition closely.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 27-year-old Chinese Han female. You were accidentally noted to have a low SUA level on two occasions during your routine check-ups in the local hospital. How have you been feeling lately?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling fine. I don't have any discomfort or pain.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you experienced any joint pain, loin pain, hematuria, urine foam, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or diarrhea?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Alright. Since you were asymptomatic but had those low SUA levels, you were admitted into the metabolism division at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University for further investigation. We performed thorough laboratory and imaging examinations. The biochemical tests confirmed the diagnosis of hypouricemia, with your SUA level at 0.33 mg/dl, and hyperuricosuria, with your FEUA at 50%.
Patient: Hmm, what are the normal ranges for those levels?
Doctor: The current reference ranges for SUA used in our laboratory department are 3.5–7.0 mg/dL in males and 2.5–6.0 mg/dL in females. As for FEUA, the reference range is 4–10%, irrespective of gender. So your levels are quite low.
Patient: I see. Were there any other findings?
Doctor: Other biomedical findings were within normal range or negative. We also performed an ultrasound, and no kidney stones were found. We excluded acquired hypouricemia resulting from Fanconi syndrome and other clinical disorders.
Patient: That's a relief. What about my family's medical history?
Doctor: Both of your parents are alive and healthy, with no evident medical history such as urolithiasis and AKI. Your father's SUA concentration is 3.68 mg/dl, which is within the lower-normal range, and your mother's is 4.35 mg/dl, which is within the fully normal range. A FEUA test was not performed for both parents because they refused to have it done. You don't have any siblings, and there is no history of hereditary diseases or specific physical abnormalities in your family.
Patient: Oh, okay. I did mention to the doctor that I'm a vegetarian and don't really eat meat. Does that have anything to do with my condition?
Doctor: It's possible that your diet could contribute to your low SUA levels, but based on the overall information, it's not the sole reason for your hypouricemia and hyperuricosuria.
Patient: Alright. So, what's the next step? Do I need any special treatment?
Doctor: At this moment, no special treatment is recommended. We will continue to monitor your condition and perform regular check-ups to ensure there are no complications. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet, and keep in touch with your healthcare team for any concerns or questions.

FEUA was recorded at 50%, well above the normal range of 4–10%. Other biochemical tests and ultrasound imaging did not reveal any abnormalities, and no kidney stones were found. Both parents have normal SUA levels, and no FEUA tests were performed on them.\nA: The patient was diagnosed with hypouricemia and hyperuricosuria. The absence of symptoms such as joint pain or kidney issues, along with normal imaging results, rules out acute complications like urolithiasis or Fanconi syndrome. The patient's vegetarian diet may contribute to low SUA levels but is not considered the primary cause of her condition.\nP: No special treatment is recommended at this time. The plan includes regular monitoring of the patient's condition with follow-up check-ups to ensure no development of complications. The patient is advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet and to stay in contact with her healthcare team for any emerging concerns or questions.

She reports no joint pain, loin pain, hematuria, urine foam, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or diarrhea. She has no history of joint pain, loin pain, hematuria, urine foam, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or diarrhea. She is a vegetarian and doesn't eat meat.
O: Laboratory tests confirmed hypouricemia with SUA at 0.33 mg/dl and hyperuricosuria with a FEUA of 50%. Ultrasound showed no kidney stones. Biochemical tests confirmed hypouricemia and hyperuricosuria, with SUA at 0.33 mg/dl and FEUA at 50%.
A: The primary diagnosis is hypouricemia and hyperuricosuria. Differential diagnoses could include acquired hypouricemia from Fanconi syndrome or other clinical disorders, but these were ruled out based on laboratory and imaging findings. The patient's low SUA levels and hyperuricosuria are likely related to her vegetarian diet and lifestyle.
P: The patient will continue to monitor her condition closely and follow up with her healthcare team for any concerns or changes in her symptoms. She is advised to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle to support her low SUA levels and manage her hyperuricosuria. Regular check-ups will be performed to monitor her progress and adjust treatment as necessary. "
"Doctor: Hello, I'm the oncologist who will be treating you. We have diagnosed you with locally advanced rectal carcinoma that is infiltrating the dental line and has lymph node metastases. We found this through a computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. a) and a proctoscopy. You came to us with problems with defecation, constipation, and tumor-related anemia. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having a lot of trouble with those issues lately.
Doctor: I understand that you also experienced painful stenosis, which prevented us from performing an endoscopic ultrasound. Apart from hypothyroidism, do you have any significant preexisting diseases or a history of cancer in close family members?
Patient: No, I don't have any other diseases, and there's no history of cancer in my family.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for the information. It seems that you haven't been exposed to any occupational noxae, and you don't smoke or drink substantial quantities of alcohol, which is good to know. We performed a histological examination of a biopsy specimen of the tumor, and it revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a large cell NEC component. We confirmed this by strong diffuse staining for synaptophysin and CD56. The result of chromogranin A testing was negative, and your Ki67 index was greater than 80%.
Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: It means that the NEC component has a high grade, specifically grade 3 (G3) NEC of large cell type. We also found more than ten metastases in both lobes of your liver through a CT scan. So, your TNM stage is cT3cN1cM1. 
Patient: That is worrisome. What's the plan for treatment?
Doctor: We will be starting you on a regimen of cisplatin (CDDP; 20 mg/m2 on days 1–5, every 4 weeks) in combination with irinotecan (IRI; 50 mg/m2/day on days 1/8/15, every 4 weeks), which is known for its efficacy in both colorectal cancer and NEC. In parallel, we will also perform conventionally fractionated pelvic radiotherapy up to 50.4 Gy (reference point dose, intensity-modulated radiation therapy) to help alleviate your pain.
Patient: Okay, I understand. I hope this treatment helps me.
Doctor: We will closely monitor your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. It's important to follow the treatment timeline and let us know if you experience any new symptoms or side effects.
Patient: I will, thank you for explaining everything to me. I really appreciate it.
Doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help you through this journey.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I'm a 38-year-old Liberian female and I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant. I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks.
Doctor: I see. Let's check your vital signs and do a physical exam. *After checking* Your vital signs are stable and your physical exam shows a gravida abdomen, but is otherwise unremarkable. We'll need to do some laboratory examinations to further investigate your symptoms.
Patient: Okay, what kind of tests will you do?
Doctor: We'll start with a blood test to measure your beta hCG levels and perform a pelvic ultrasound. *After tests* Your beta hCG level is 118471 and the ultrasound has confirmed a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. We'll admit you to the hospital for close monitoring.
Patient: Alright, thank you.
Doctor: During your hospital stay, you developed a massive pleural effusion, low-grade fever, progressive worsening abdominal pain, and a spontaneous abortion. We performed a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your chest, which revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion. We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis, which showed bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, thickening and enhancement of the peritoneum, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue, which is suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?
Doctor: We consulted with surgical and oncology specialists for the possibility of exploratory laparotomy and discussed treatment options for presumed ovarian neoplasm. We also did more blood work, which revealed an elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. However, your adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are within normal limits.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We performed a diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy, which revealed significant pelvis ascites and diffuse miliary lesions throughout the peritoneum. You then underwent dilatation and curettage. The histopathologic examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with no evidence of neoplasm.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: Special stains on the tissue sections and ascitic fluid stain revealed rare acid-fast bacilli, which suggests mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis. Upon further questioning, you indicated that you had a positive PPD skin test a year ago but didn't receive any follow-up treatment. We have started you on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy.
Patient: Will that help me recover?
Doctor: Yes, with the appropriate treatment, you should have a complete recovery. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team and complete the full course of the therapy.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow your advice.","S: The patient is a 38-year-old Liberian female, 12 weeks pregnant, presenting with low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks.

Patient: Yeah, my right leg has been really swollen and painful. It's been difficult to walk around.
Doctor: I understand. So, before your surgical thrombectomy, you received a suprarenal IVC filter due to the short distance between the thrombus in the distal IVC and the inflow of renal veins. The surgical access was established via venotomy of the common femoral vein, and an occlusion balloon was used for the thrombectomy. How did you feel after the procedure?
Patient: I felt a bit better, but still had some pain and swelling in my leg.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. In a follow-up CT, we found that the filter had dislodged and tilted towards the right IVC wall with its legs piercing the contralateral wall and extending into the left renal vein. This was likely due to the surgical thrombectomy. You were given oral anticoagulation with Warfarin, but unfortunately, there was a re-thrombosis. We then performed catheter-directed thrombolysis, including stenting of the common iliac veins and the IVC. However, we didn't attempt filter retrieval at that time due to the large amount of clot within the filter.
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what happened next?
Doctor: After 5 weeks of Warfarin therapy, you were scheduled for a retrieval, which was considered mandatory due to the displaced and tilted filter with penetrating legs. We introduced a 14-F sheath, an SOS catheter, a Bentson wire, and an EN Snare to create a loop. We attempted the single loop-snare technique several times, but it kept slipping around the filter legs.
Patient: That sounds difficult. What did you do then?
Doctor: To stabilize the loop, we formed a second loop using the same technique around the filter tip. With two loops around the filter tip, we were finally able to successfully pull the filter away from the wall and into the 14F sheath.
Patient: That's a relief! What's the next step now?
Doctor: A follow-up venography will be performed to ensure that the filter has been successfully removed and to monitor your condition. You'll need to continue taking your anticoagulation medication and follow up with us regularly to prevent any future complications.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll make sure to follow your instructions and keep you updated on my progress.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions.","S: The patient is a 31-year-old female presenting with symptoms of postpartum deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in her right leg, characterized by significant swelling and pain, making it difficult to walk.

O: The patient underwent a surgical thrombectomy with a suprarenal IVC filter placement, which later dislodged and tilted, complicating her condition.

"Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been coughing up blood for the past three days, and I'm really worried.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any similar symptoms in the past?
Patient: Yeah, I had massive haemoptysis last year, but they couldn't identify any disorder during my follow-up examination.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any significant past medical history we should be aware of?
Patient: Yes, I have hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and atrioventricular block. I also have an implanted dual chamber pacemaker. Oh, and I don't have a history of smoking.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. Let's start with a physical examination. We'll check your vitals and listen to your lungs.
[After examination]
Doctor: Your blood pressure is 146/72 mmHg, pulse is 86 beats/min, temperature is 36.6 °C, respiratory rate is 20/min, and your blood oxygen saturation level is 95% on room air. Your physical examination seems unremarkable, without any coarse crackles on the right lung field. We'll also need to perform some laboratory tests to check if everything is within normal limits.
[After receiving laboratory test results]
Doctor: Your laboratory test results are within normal limits. We'll need to take a chest radiograph to further investigate the issue.
[After reviewing the chest radiograph]
Doctor: Your chest radiograph shows a homogenous, flat opacity along the right heart border in the lower lung field (Fig. A). We'll perform a chest computed tomography (CT) scan to get a better understanding of your condition.
[After reviewing the chest CT scan]
Doctor: The chest CT scan demonstrated a consolidation due to a collapsed right lower lobe and a diaphragmatic hernia (Fig. B). Interestingly, a chest CT performed five years ago showed an expanded bronchus in the small right lower lobe, suggesting pulmonary hypoplasia of the right inferior lobe (Fig. C). Let's move forward with a dynamic CT angiography to check for any blood leakage.
[After reviewing the dynamic CT angiography]
Doctor: We couldn't detect any extravasation of blood on the arterial and venous phase in the angiography. However, a bronchoscopic examination revealed that your right inferior lobar bronchus was filled with blood clots (Fig. D).
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is concerning. We performed a bronchial artery angiography, which confirmed the expansion and meandering of the bronchial arteries and the growth of the reticular artery from the diaphragm arteries (Fig. E). We attempted two arterial embolizations and also plugged an endobronchial Watanabe spigot into your right inferior lobar bronchus, but unfortunately, they failed to stop the haemoptysis.
Patient: What's the next step then?
Doctor: We had to perform a thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy to remove the affected area. The excised surgical specimen presented a small hypoaerated, atrophied, and occluded right inferior lobe. The bronchus was underdeveloped and irregular throughout its running (Fig. F).
Patient: I see. What should I do now, Doctor?
Doctor: It's important to monitor your condition closely and follow up with us regularly. We'll keep an eye on any changes and manage your symptoms as needed. We're here to support you through this process.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a non-smoker with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrioventricular block, and an implanted dual chamber pacemaker, presents with a chief complaint of coughing up blood for the past three days. He reports a similar episode of massive haemoptysis last year, which remained undiagnosed after evaluation.
O: Physical examination shows blood pressure at 146/72 mmHg, pulse 86 beats/min, temperature 36.6 °C, respiratory rate 20/min, and blood oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals no coarse crackles in the right lung field. Laboratory tests are within normal limits. Chest radiograph indicates a flat opacity along the right heart border in the lower lung field. Chest CT scan shows consolidation due to collapsed right lower lobe and a diaphragmatic hernia.

Bronchial artery angiography shows expansion and meandering of bronchial arteries and growth of the reticular artery from the diaphragm arteries. Despite two arterial embolizations and placement of an endobronchial Watanabe spigot, haemoptysis was not controlled, leading to a thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy. The excised lobe was hypoaerated, atrophied, and had an underdeveloped, irregular bronchus.
A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent haemoptysis due to a structurally abnormal and diseased right lower lobe, likely exacerbated by underlying pulmonary hypoplasia and vascular abnormalities. Differential diagnoses previously considered included undiagnosed bleeding disorders or malignancy, which have been ruled out by investigations and surgical findings.
P: The patient will require close monitoring and regular follow-up to manage any postoperative complications and to monitor for recurrence of symptoms. It is important to manage his chronic conditions, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and ensure that his pacemaker function is regularly checked. Patient education regarding signs of infection, proper wound care, and when to seek immediate medical attention is crucial.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 62-year-old, right-handed male carrier. Have you been experiencing any tremor or ataxia recently?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any tremors or problems with balance.
Doctor: Good to know. We just took your vitals during the examination. Your blood pressure is 125/88 mmHg, and your heart rate is 88 bpm. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
Patient: Yes, I'm taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide to control it.
Doctor: Great, it seems that those medications are helping. Your BMI is 26.9, which is slightly above the normal range. Now, we did some tests during the examination, such as finger-to-nose touching and tandem walk. You showed no difficulty in performing these tasks.
Patient: Yes, I didn't have any problems with those tests.
Doctor: We also noticed a slight increased tone in your right and left extremities, but your movements were symmetrical. Your deep tendon reflexes were normal, scoring a 2+ in all four extremities.
Patient: Hmm, that's good to know.
Doctor: Additionally, your vibration sense, tactile sensation, and cold sensation were all normal. We didn't find any cognitive abnormalities during the neuropsychological examination, and you haven't reported any psychiatric symptoms, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. I haven't experienced any issues in those areas.
Doctor: That's great. We also conducted an MRI, which revealed the MCP sign. There were some additional white matter changes detected in the splenium of the corpus callosum.
Patient: Oh, what does that mean?

Patient: Yes, I had some treatment to control the inflammation.
Doctor: Good. Did you have any tests done after the inflammation was controlled?
Patient: Yes, I had a barium esophagography done.
Doctor: Alright. And what did the results show?
Patient: The results showed a PSF on the left side of my neck.
Doctor: Okay, and did you have a CT scan as well?
Patient: Yes, and it showed an air- and barium-containing fistula.
Doctor: I understand. We decided to perform a MLS as the first-line treatment for you. Do you remember the details of the procedure?
Patient: Hmm, I remember the doctor saying that the fistula was narrow and the tissue wasn't fragile.
Doctor: That's correct. We made the incision as small as possible during the surgery (Fig. , ). The operation was completed uneventfully (Fig. ). On the fifth postoperative day, we performed another barium esophagography. Did you experience any leakage after that?
Patient: No, there wasn't any leakage.
Doctor: Great. You were able to start free oral intake on the same day, right?
Patient: Yes, I was able to eat and drink without any problems.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. You had an uneventful recovery and were discharged from the hospital 7 days after the surgery. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've been feeling much better, and I haven't had any recurrence of the swelling.

Patient: Yes, I've been dealing with self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse for 20 years now. I've been taking more than 200 tablets per day.
Doctor: That's quite severe. Have you received any previous treatments for this issue?
Patient: Yes, I've had supportive psychotherapy and symptomatic treatment from psychiatrists, including being hospitalized 13 times.
Doctor: I see. During the physical examination, we noticed some epigastric vein dilatation and striae cutis distensae on your swelling abdomen, which was filled with ascites. We also conducted some blood tests. The results indicated hypoalbuminemia, increased hepatic and biliary enzyme levels, an increased creatinine level, hypokalemia, and anemia. Have you experienced any symptoms related to these findings?
Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired and weak lately.
Doctor: That could be due to the anemia. We also performed an abdominal ultrasonogram, which showed findings of chronic hepatitis, such as an irregular liver surface, a dull margin, and heterogeneity of the parenchyma. A computed tomography scan revealed a gastro-renal shunt, but no varices were detected. We suspected portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis, so we performed a liver biopsy.
Patient: What did the liver biopsy show?
Doctor: The biopsy showed only slight pericellular fibrosis without evidence of liver cirrhosis. However, liver fibrosis was proven by the increase in liver fibrosis markers, such as type IV collagen 7S (8.5 ng/mL) and hyaluronic acid (400 ng/mL). We also conducted psychological testing, which showed remarkable depression and anxiety.
Patient: What's the plan for my treatment?
Doctor: During your inpatient care, we provided nutritional treatment and diuretic drugs to control the ascites. After your general state improved, we initiated an inpatient cognitive behavioral treatment. You were discharged 2 months after admission because your ascites almost disappeared and your body weight increased by approximately 3 kg.

Doctor: Unfortunately, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), and creatinine were not significantly improved.
Patient: What can I do now?
Doctor: During our 3-month follow-up, we found that your ascites were well controlled with diuretic drugs. We would like you to limit your daily activities to prevent any complications.

An inpatient cognitive behavioral treatment was initiated. The patient is advised to limit daily activities to prevent complications and continue with diuretic therapy to manage ascites. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and psychological support is essential. Follow-up in three months to reassess the condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.'}]",[],"S: The patient reports a 20-year history of self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse. The patient has been taking more than 200 tablets per day for 20 years. The patient has received supportive psychotherapy and symptomatic treatment from psychiatrists, including hospitalization 13 times.
O: Physical examination revealed epigastric vein dilatation and striae cutis distensae on the abdomen, filled with ascites. Blood tests indicated hypoalbuminemia, increased hepatic and biliary enzyme levels, anemia, and hyperkalemia. Abdominal ultrasonography showed chronic hepatitis, an irregular liver surface, a dull margin, and heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma. A computed tomography scan revealed a gastro-renal shunt, but no varices were detected. Liver biopsy showed only slight pericellular fibrosis without liver cirrhosis. Liver biopsy showed type IV pericellular fibrosis without evidence of liver cirrhosis. Psychological testing showed remarkable depression and anxiety.
A: The primary diagnosis is chronic hepatitis and liver fibrosis, likely caused by liver cirrhosis. The patient's self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse may be secondary to these conditions. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of ascites and liver fibrosis.
P: The management plan includes nutritional treatment and diuretic therapy to control the ascites and liver fibrosis. The patient was discharged 2 months after admission due to the resolution of ascites and weight increase. The patient was advised to limit daily activities to prevent complications. Regular monitoring of serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, ALT, ALP, gamma-GTP, creatinine, and liver fibrosis markers will be performed to assess progress and adjust treatment as necessary. The patient was advised to report any new symptoms or changes in his condition immediately. "
"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 55-year-old African American male with a significant past medical history of breast cancer. What brings you in today?
Patient: I recently had a surveillance computed tomography (CT) scan of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and they found something.
Doctor: Yes, I see here that the CT scan showed incidental acute appendicitis. Were you experiencing any symptoms when you came in for the scan?
Patient: No, I was asymptomatic during the scan, but in the following days, I developed nausea and vomiting along with right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
Doctor: That's consistent with appendicitis. We'll have to admit you to the general surgery service for treatment. I also noticed from your chart that you have an extensive history with cancer, is that correct?
Patient: Yeah, it all started in 2014 when I had a resection of an enlarging, ulcerating chest mass on the right side.
Doctor: I see that the pathology report from the wide local excision of the mass demonstrated estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and HER2/neu-negative metastatic adenocarcinoma. At the time, the primary source of the cancer was unknown. You underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, both of which were normal, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. My oncology team has been closely monitoring me, and I've been treated with tamoxifen for hormone therapy.
Doctor: I also noticed that in May of 2017, due to an enlarged anterior mediastinal wall lymph node discovered on CT surveillance, you underwent a CT-guided biopsy and positron emission tomography (PET). The biopsy was negative for malignancy, but the PET showed abnormal hypermetabolic activity within a retrosternal nodule, intense activity in a mixed focus in the manubrium, and several hypermetabolic nodes within the mediastinum. It also showed an abnormal hypermetabolic focus in the cecum, which was suspicious for a colon primary. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, they tried to do a colonoscopy, but the gastroenterologist couldn't advance the colonoscope past the transverse colon due to technical reasons.
Doctor: I see. Medical oncology decided to continue with close surveillance. In January 2018, you developed right axillary lymphadenopathy, and an ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. What were the results of that biopsy?
Patient: I don't remember exactly, can you please check my records?
Doctor: Yes, let me take a look. It appears that the biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma with the same hormone receptor profile as your original breast cancer. Your oncology team will need to adjust your treatment plan accordingly. In the meantime, we need to focus on treating your appendicitis. After your surgery, make sure to follow up with your oncologist for further evaluation and management of your cancer.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come to our services for exertional dyspnoea. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble breathing when I exert myself.
Doctor: I understand. I see from your medical history that you had aortic valve stenosis and received an orthotopic heart transplantation in 1994 for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, we don't have the data from your transplant procedure as it was done 23 years ago. Have you experienced any issues since then?
Patient: No, not really. I've been mostly asymptomatic except for paroxysmal atrial flutter. I got a single chamber pacemaker in 2008 and then had an atrial flutter ablation in 2010.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you been adhering to your medication regimen?
Patient: Yep, I've been taking my meds as prescribed.
Doctor: Great. It seems that you haven't shown any signs of transplant rejection on several cardiac biopsies. However, you do have some post-transplant cardiovascular risk factors like systemic hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and stable stage 4 chronic renal dysfunction with an eGFR of 23 mL/min/1.73 m2. We've been monitoring your condition with serial transthoracic echocardiography at our institution, and it has shown progressive degenerative aortic valve disease. 
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: At your presentation, the transthoracic echocardiography showed degenerative bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps. The appearance of the valve is consistent with severe aortic stenosis, which was confirmed by hemodynamic Doppler assessment. It revealed a peak gradient of 65 mm Hg, an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 derived from the continuity equation, and a dimensionless velocity index of 0.24. Your left ventricular function is normal with an ejection fraction of 59% by Simpson's method.
Patient: So, what does all that mean, doc?
Doctor: We performed further evaluation using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) to assess your aortic valve and aorto-iliac anatomy. It confirmed the morphology of a heavily calcific bicuspid aortic valve and the absence of associated aortopathy. It also showed that you're suitable for a transfemoral approach. The maximal aortic annulus dimension was measured as 25 mm with an aortic root diameter of 32 mm at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva.
Patient: Okay, and what about my coronary arteries?
Doctor: We performed coronary angiography to screen for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and did not find any evidence of obstructive coronary disease.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: One more thing, upon admission, we noted that you were bradycardic with episodes. We will continue to monitor your condition and discuss the best treatment options for your case.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I am a 75-year-old woman, and I've been having a loss of appetite for a week now. I'm 132 cm tall and weigh 34 kg.
Doctor: I see. Are you taking any medications currently?
Patient: Yes, I take aspirin, celecoxib, and amlodipine for angina and hypertension.
Doctor: Alright. I will need to run some laboratory examinations to better understand your condition. 
*After the examinations*
Doctor: Your lab results show that your Hb has decreased modestly to 10.7 g/dl. I would like to monitor your condition and ask that you return in two weeks for a follow-up.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
*Two weeks later*
Patient: Doctor, my anorexia has worsened day by day, and I decided to admit myself to the hospital.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On admission day 1, you were alert and fully oriented. Your blood pressure and pulse rate were stable. However, your laboratory examinations showed that your Hb and hematocrit levels decreased remarkably to 4.8 g/dl and 15%, respectively. Your white blood count and C-reactive protein (CRP) increased slightly to 9900 /mm3 and 4.64 mg/dl, respectively. Additionally, your albumin level decreased to 2.5 g/dl and your creatine level increased slightly to 1.14 mg/dl, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 41.7 ml/min. We also conducted chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT), but it didn't detect any abnormal lesions.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: On admission day 2, you vomited large amounts of bright red blood, and your Hb level further decreased to 2.9 g/dl. We performed an urgent transfusion of 560 ml of red blood cells. An endoscopic examination detected active bleeding from a gastric ulcer, so we performed endoscopic clipping on the bleeding lesion.
Patient: I'm glad you found the issue. Did my Hb levels improve after that?
Doctor: Yes, your Hb improved to 8.9 g/dl. However, you did not respond to verbal or pain stimuli despite your eyes having opened. You showed normal light reflexes without anisocoria.

"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me why you were admitted to the hospital back in June 2016?
Patient: Yeah, I was admitted because of weakness in my right arm and problems with my speech, like slurring.
Doctor: I see. You were diagnosed with cerebral infarction in the left middle cerebral artery area and deep vein thrombosis. Your ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and echocardiography revealed no intra-cardiac thrombus or vegetation. You were then discharged with a prescription for apixaban. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: In August 2016, you were readmitted to the hospital due to recurrent right arm weakness and slurred speech. The MRI showed multiple cerebral infarctions in both cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. At this point, Trousseau's syndrome was suspected. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: So, your apixaban was stopped and you were given an intravenous drip of heparin instead. Echocardiography revealed mild mitral regurgitation with vegetation on the mitral valve. Although your lab results showed no evidence of infection, you were given ceftriaxone and gentamicin as a precaution against infective endocarditis. You were then referred to our hospital for surgery. 
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: A CT scan revealed a left renal infarction and multiple swollen lymph nodes around both the abdominal aorta and stomach with antral hypertrophy. This suggested advanced gastric cancer or lymphoma. Despite the heparin and antibiotics therapy, the vegetation on your mitral valve didn't change. So, cardiac surgery was performed on day 5 after your referral. 
Patient: Okay, and what happened during the surgery?
Doctor: During the surgery, extracorporeal circulation was instituted employing aortic and bicaval cannulation. After aortic cross-clamping, the mitral valve was exposed via a left atriotomy. Both mitral leaflets had vegetation on the surface, and a major vegetation 15 mm in width was evident on the anterior leaflet. These were resected in their entirety and replaced with a 25-mm Epic bioprosthesis.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: Continuous intravenous heparin administration was resumed the following day, aiming for an activated partial thromboplastin time of between 40 and 50 seconds. Histologic analysis revealed that the vegetations were actually thrombi covered with vascular endothelium and that your mitral leaflet tissue was not damaged. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with NB.
Patient: So, what's the next step for me?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your medications as needed. It's important that you attend all follow-up appointments and report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare team.

"Doctor: Hi there, I heard you've been experiencing some wrist pain and unsightly appearance of your wrist after a previous fracture. Can you please describe how it feels and when these symptoms started to develop?
Patient: Yeah, the pain is mostly on the ulnar side of my wrist, and it started about a year after the fracture. The appearance of my wrist seems a bit deformed too.
Doctor: I see. Based on the physical examination and the tests we ran, it appears that you have a growth plate fracture in your right distal radius, specifically a Salter–Harris type II fracture. You were initially treated with cast immobilization and closed reduction, which allowed the fracture to heal. However, the wrist pain and deformity you're experiencing now are due to a condition called partial physeal arrest.
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?
Doctor: Partial physeal arrest occurs when the growth plate in your wrist is damaged, causing it to stop growing properly. In your case, radiographs showed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and an abnormal radial inclination of the articular surface. A CT scan was also performed to evaluate the deformity and for preoperative simulation with a low-radiation setting.
Patient: So, what's the plan to fix this?
Doctor: We have planned a two-stage operation for you. The first stage will involve a procedure called distraction osteogenesis to gradually lengthen the affected bone. The second stage will be the Langenskiöld procedure, which aims to remove the physeal bar and reestablish physeal growth.
Patient: Will this help with the pain and appearance of my wrist?
Doctor: Yes, the goal of the operation is to correct the deformities of the wrist and improve its appearance and function. In the first operation, we'll use a closed-wedge osteotomy to correct the distal radius, and an external fixator called the Orthofix MiniRail Fixator™ will be used for lengthening.
Patient: Okay, that sounds good. What do I need to do to prepare for the surgery?
Doctor: We have obtained informed consent from your guardians to report the procedure and proceed with the operation. All procedures have been approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution, and we will adhere to all of the recommended guidelines for an experimental investigation involving human subjects.
Patient: Got it. Thank you for explaining everything to me. I'm looking forward to getting this fixed.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We'll be here to support you throughout the process.","S: The patient reports persistent pain on the ulnar side of the right wrist and noticeable deformity, starting approximately one year after a fracture. The patient describes the pain as localized and the wrist as appearing deformed.
O: Physical examination and diagnostic imaging confirmed a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the right distal radius with subsequent partial physeal arrest. Radiographs revealed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and abnormal radial inclination. A CT scan was performed to further evaluate the deformity and assist in preoperative planning, using a low-radiation setting.
A: The primary diagnosis is partial physeal arrest secondary to a previously treated Salter-Harris type II fracture of the right distal radius. The patient exhibits a shortening deformity and abnormal radial inclination, contributing to pain and aesthetic concerns.
P: A two-stage surgical intervention is planned.

Can you please describe how it feels and when these symptoms started to develop?\nPatient: Yeah, the pain is mostly on the ulnar side of my wrist, and it started about a year after the fracture. The appearance of my wrist seems a bit deformed too.\nDoctor: I see. Based on the physical examination and the tests we ran, it appears that you have a growth plate fracture in your right distal radius, specifically a Salter–Harris type II fracture. You were initially treated with cast immobilization and closed reduction, which allowed the fracture to heal. However, the wrist pain and deformity you're experiencing now are due to a condition called partial physeal arrest.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: Partial physeal arrest occurs when the growth plate in your wrist is damaged, causing it to stop growing properly. In your case, radiographs showed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and an abnormal radial inclination of the articular surface. A CT scan was also performed to evaluate the deformity and for preoperative simulation with a low-radiation setting.\nPatient: So, what's the plan to fix this?\nDoctor: We have planned a two-stage operation for you. The first stage will involve a procedure called distraction osteogenesis to gradually lengthen the affected bone. The second stage will be the Langenskiöld procedure, which aims to remove the physeal bar and reestablish physeal growth.\nPatient: Will this help with the pain and appearance of my wrist?\nDoctor: Yes, the goal of the operation is to correct the deformities of the wrist and improve its appearance and function. In the first operation, we'll use a closed-wedge osteotomy to correct the distal radius, and an external fixator called the Orthofix MiniRail Fixator™ will be used for lengthening.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. What do I need to do to prepare for the surgery?\nDoctor: We have obtained informed consent from your guardians to report the procedure and proceed with the operation. All procedures have been approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution, and we will adhere to all of the recommended guidelines for an experimental investigation involving human subjects.\nPatient: Got it. Thank you for explaining everything to me. I'm looking forward to getting this fixed.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We'll be here to support you throughout the process.""}

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some issues lately. I work at a shrimp farm in Yingkou, and I had watery diarrhea on August 24th.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms and any relevant history?
Patient: Well, I had a single episode of watery diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting after consuming raw mollusc from the sediment in Yingkou. I don't have any immune-compromising diseases, and I don't abuse alcohol.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. How did you manage your symptoms after the episode?
Patient: I took ciprofloxacin for two days, and the watery diarrhea disappeared after three days of antibiotic treatment.
Doctor: Okay, it seems that the antibiotic helped. Did you have any laboratory tests done?
Patient: Yes, I had some biochemical tests and my white blood cell count was high, 14 × 109/L. They also did a stool culture.
Doctor: Were there any findings from the stool culture?
Patient: The stool culture was spread onto Thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose and MacConkey agar plates, and it showed suspected positive results for V. cholerae.
Doctor: I see. Were there any further tests done to confirm the presence of V. cholerae?
Patient: Yes, they obtained a pure culture and identified the bacterium as V. cholerae through the VITEK-2 bacterial identifier system and sequencing of the 16S rDNA genes.
Doctor: Did they perform any tests to determine the specific strain of V. cholerae?
Patient: They did an agglutination test with O1 and O139 antisera, and it showed that the strain was a non-O1/O139 V. cholerae.
Doctor: Alright. Were there any tests conducted to assess the virulence factors of the V. cholerae strain?
Patient: Yes, they did a PCR test for outer membrane protein, TCP expression, haemagglutinin, protease, and central regulatory protein, among others.
Doctor: What were the results of the PCR tests?
Patient: The results showed that the strain was only positive for the outer membrane protein, TCP expression, haemagglutinin, protease, and central regulatory protein.

Our physical examination showed mild enlargement of your liver, no pitting edema in both legs, and no coarse crackles over the lung fields. The laboratory findings are presented in the table, which we'll discuss shortly.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: Additionally, a chest radiography showed absence of pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly. Electrocardiography was not performed on admission. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen revealed minimal pericardial effusion, diffuse swelling, and an internal heterogeneous image in the liver.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: These findings are compatible with acute hepatitis. Although we didn't examine your cardiac function, the other results indicate that you are experiencing acute hepatitis, which might be the cause of your symptoms.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What should we do now?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition and provide appropriate treatment to manage your symptoms and the underlying cause of the hepatitis. It's important that you follow our recommendations and attend any follow-up appointments to ensure your recovery.\nPatient: Yes, of course. Thank you, doctor.""}

"Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was diagnosed with left temporal glial neoplasia in May 2014 after I had a seizure.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms and the tests you had done?
Patient: Well, I had an MRI which showed an infiltrative lesion with poorly defined contours in my left temporal lobe. It also showed an increase in the left temporal gyrus cortex.
Doctor: Hmm, it seems like the lesion compromised a large part of your temporal lobe and extended to the temporal isthmus, the posterior aspect of the insula, and was deep in the trigeminal effigy of the left lateral ventricle. There was also diffuse erasure of the regional cortical sulci and the Sylvian fissure, with slight compression over the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. Did you have a biopsy done to confirm the diagnosis?
Patient: Yes, I had a stereotactic biopsy in April 2014, and it indicated oligodendroglioma grade II.
Doctor: Okay, and how has your treatment been going since then?
Patient: I received TMZ with cycles every 23 days from September 2014 to July 2015. But in 2016, there was tumor growth, so I had an MRI in February.
Doctor: What did the MRI show about the evolution of the tumor?
Patient: The MRI showed an increase in the dimensions of the remaining lesion, especially in the temporal isthmus, which had a similar expansive effect on the adjacent encephalic structures.
Doctor: I understand. And what was the next step in your treatment?
Patient: I underwent a partial surgical resection followed by chemoradiation and lasting 6 cycles of PCV associated with CBD. The CBD dosage ranged from 100 to 200 mg/day.
Doctor: How was your overall health and well-being during the chemoradiation?
Patient: I had an excellent clinical performance, practiced sports, and only had a few symptoms of fatigue and nausea.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Did you have an MRI control after the chemoradiation to assess the results?
Patient: Yes, the MRI control was used to characterize post-operative changes and showed a significant reduction of the infiltrative components of the tumor.
Doctor: That's promising. What was the result of the pathological study after your surgeries?
Patient: After the first surgery, I was still diagnosed with oligodendroglioma grade II. But after the second surgery, I was diagnosed with oligodendroglioma grade III due to an increase in Ki67 staining of 9%.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of this information. Based on your current situation, we can discuss the next steps in your treatment plan and continue to monitor your progress closely. It's important to keep an open line of communication and report any new symptoms or concerns you may have.","S: The patient, diagnosed with left temporal glial neoplasia (oligodendroglioma grade II initially, later progressed to grade III) in May 2014, reports a history of seizures, tumor growth, and treatments including TMZ chemotherapy, partial surgical resection, chemoradiation, and PCV with CBD. Symptoms experienced include fatigue and nausea, but overall well-being has been good with active participation in sports.
O: Initial MRI revealed an infiltrative lesion in the left temporal lobe with poorly defined contours and increased cortex in the left temporal gyrus. Subsequent MRIs showed progression and post-treatment reduction of the tumor. Biopsy confirmed oligodendroglioma grade II, which later progressed to grade III based on increased Ki67 staining of 9%. The patient's clinical performance has been excellent despite the diagnosis and treatments.
A: The primary diagnosis is oligodendroglioma, currently grade III, with a history of progression from grade II. Differential diagnoses were likely considered and ruled out through biopsy and imaging. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the significant reduction in tumor size post-treatment, though the progression to a higher grade indicates a potentially more aggressive disease course.
P: Continue regular monitoring through MRI and clinical assessments to detect any further changes in tumor status or progression. Maintain current regimen of chemoradiation and consider adjustments based on tumor response and side effects. Encourage continued physical activity as tolerated and manage symptoms of fatigue and nausea as needed. Ensure open communication for reporting new symptoms or concerns.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were referred to our department in June 2011 by a head and neck surgeon to improve your upper denture retention and stability. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
Patient: Sure, doc. I was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary gingiva in May 2005. I had to undergo a bunch of surgeries like extended left maxillectomy, anterior and middle cranial base resection, left ophthalmectomy, and flap reconstruction using the rectus abdominis muscle.
Doctor: I see. During your physical examination, I noticed a recessed deformation on the left side of your face due to the left ophthalmectomy. The function of your left levator palpebrae muscle has been eliminated to a slight elevation using the frontal muscle. There's also a metal plate anchored to the inferior wall of your orbit. How have you been managing with these changes?
Patient: It's been tough, but I'm getting used to it.
Doctor: I also observed that during the mesh titanium plate reconstruction, your left ethmoid bone, inferior nasal turbinate, maxilla, alisphenoid, medial and lateral pterygoid muscle were excised. Intraorally, your left maxilla has been excised from the midline and the rectus abdominis muscle flap was sutured directly to your soft palate. The peripheral mucous membrane around your left upper lip is scarred, without the oral vestibule. Have you experienced any discomfort or difficulty with this?
Patient: Yes, sometimes it's uncomfortable and the flap margin has moved along with the surrounding soft tissue.
Doctor: I see that the 70 × 50 mm flap is sagging from its weight and is in contact with your mandibular molars, which reduces the volume of your oral cavity unless you wear dentures. Your maxilla has been removed from the midline to the maxillary tuberosity, while your mandible has been removed from the anterior border of the ramus to the coronoid process. Has this caused any issues with your dentures?
Patient: Yeah, it's been a bit difficult to adjust to them.
Doctor: During the reconstruction, the dead space was eliminated by placing the abdominal rectus muscle from the anterior cranial base to the oral cavity (Fig.). Have you noticed any expiratory leakage or food reflux?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any leakage or food reflux.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Prior to performing surgery, there was no tumor recurrence or metastasis detected. Have you been keeping up with your follow-up appointments to monitor your condition?
Patient: Yes, I have been attending all my follow-up appointments.
Doctor: Great. I also see that you have a mouth opening of 43 mm. Are you experiencing any difficulties with this mouth opening size?
Patient: Not really, I can manage with it.
Doctor: Alright. Based on our conversation and my examination, we will work on improving your denture retention and stability. We may need to make adjustments to your current dentures or consider other options to ensure your comfort and proper function. Please continue to attend your follow-up appointments so we can monitor your condition closely.

"Doctor: Hello there, I see you've brought your 7-year-old son in today. What seems to be the problem?
Parent: Hi, Doctor. We're from Miandoab. He suddenly started experiencing febrile serial generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was hospitalized in Shahid Abbasi teaching Hospital.
Doctor: I see. Has he had any history of prenatal or postnatal diseases?
Parent: No, he has had a normal growth and just completed the first grade of primary school. His mother and I are cousins, but we are both healthy.
Doctor: Okay. So, after controlling his seizures with bolus doses of phenobarbital and phenytoin, did his condition improve?
Parent: Unfortunately, his consciousness level decreased, and he needed endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. Then he was transferred to the tertiary subspecialty ward in Urmia’s Motahari Hospital.
Doctor: I understand. When I first examined him, he was in a deep coma, but his vital signs were normal. Upon further physical examination, I noticed his pupils were dilated with an inadequate response to light, his liver was palpable about 4 cm below the costal margin, his muscular tone was severely diminished, and deep tendon reflexes were undetectable. His examination was otherwise normal.
Parent: What do the laboratory tests say about his condition?
Doctor: The routine laboratory tests revealed a nonketotic hypoglycemia and elevated liver enzymes. We consulted with an endocrinologist and took blood and urine samples for further evaluation into the exact cause of his hypoglycemia.
Parent: What did those tests reveal?
Doctor: The tests ruled out several possible causes including lipid malabsorption (TG=92 mg/dl, cholesterol 73 mg/dl, LDL=37 mg/dl), disorders of the respiratory chain (lactate=13 ng/dl), adrenal insufficiency (cortisol=62.4µg/dl), hypopituitarism (ACTH=411 pg/ml), and hyper insulinemia (insulin=0.7µIU/ml).
Parent: Did you find any viral or immune cause for his hepatitis?
Doctor: Our pediatric gastroenterologist suggested additional laboratory tests to detect any viral or immune cause of hepatitis, but unfortunately, those tests revealed nothing. The urine toxicology screening test was also negative.
Parent: What should we do now, Doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to closely monitor your son's condition and provide the necessary care. We will also consult with other specialists and perform any additional tests if needed. We'll do our best to find the cause of his condition and provide appropriate treatment.","S: The patient, a 7-year-old boy, presented with sudden onset of febrile serial generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

The patient's parents are first cousins; however, there is no reported history of prenatal or postnatal diseases. The patient had normal growth and development until this event.
O: On examination, the patient was in a deep coma with normal vital signs. Physical findings included dilated pupils with poor light response, liver palpable 4 cm below the costal margin, severely diminished muscular tone, and absent deep tendon reflexes.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about the injuries you sustained?
Patient: Hi, I had an electrical burn from a power line. It was pretty bad.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It looks like you had 32% total body surface area third-degree injuries. Can you tell me more about the injury to your left knee?
Patient: Yeah, my left knee got an open joint injury. It was treated with three skin grafting procedures before something else was placed.
Doctor: That's right. The SEF, or spatial external fixator, was placed 24 days after your injury to help stabilize your knee. It was kept on for 8.5 weeks. We used Shantz pins and bars as the external fixator, and it was locked in full extension. 
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what happened after the SEF was placed?
Doctor: After the SEF placement, you required two additional skin grafting procedures on your left knee. You also had a bony prominence resection while in SEF. This means we removed a protruding piece of bone to help with your recovery.
Patient: I didn't know that. Were there any complications during my treatment?
Doctor: No significant complications were recorded during your treatment, which is good news. However, I noticed that there were no PT/OT notes or follow-up recorded. 
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: PT/OT refers to physical therapy and occupational therapy. It's important to have these sessions and follow-ups to ensure proper recovery and regain function in your injured knee. 
Patient: Oh, okay. So, what should I do now?
Doctor: I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a physical therapist and an occupational therapist to assess your current condition and create a plan for your ongoing recovery.

"Doctor: Hi, I understand you recently presented to an outside institution with an acute episode of aphasia. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, it was quite sudden. I had difficulty speaking and understanding what others were saying.
Doctor: I see. The MR-imaging that was performed revealed an enhancing left temporal mass, with a maximum enhancing diameter of 2.1 cm (Fig.). The biopsy of the lesion showed that it was histologically consistent with GBM. The test results were IDH1R132H negative, 1p/19q intact, MGMT unmethylated, p53 positive, and without EGFR amplification. 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: To treat this, you underwent LITT, which involved an energy of 24.42 kJ, 876 pulses, and a time of 0:29:07. The treatment was done using a single track approximately 4 cm in length. You were discharged home on post-treatment day 2 at your neurological baseline. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: About two weeks after LITT, you came to our institution with complaints of increasing headache and calculation difficulties, despite being on corticosteroid therapy. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, the headaches were getting worse, and I had trouble doing simple math.
Doctor: I understand. The MR-imaging we did revealed tissue necrosis with hemorrhagic material within the LITT treated region and edema surrounding the treatment site. To address this, you underwent en bloc resection of the enhancing lesion and adjacent tumor-infiltrated brain via a left temporal craniotomy (Fig.). Your headache and calculation difficulties resolved after the surgery and you were discharged on post-operative day 2. 
Patient: Yes, I felt much better after the surgery.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Post-operative MR-imaging confirmed complete resection of the enhancing lesion. You also underwent adjuvant radiation therapy and were treated to a dose of 5945 cGy in 29 fractions with concurrent temozolomide. However, the maintenance temozolomide was discontinued after 5 cycles due to persistent pancytopenia.
Patient: Yeah, I remember that.
Doctor: Interestingly, there has been no surgical or medical treatment for the past 4 years, and serial MR imaging since the surgery has shown no recurrence of your disease.
Patient: That's really good news!
Doctor: Yes, it is. I also wanted to let you know that the gross specimen from your surgery was 6.5 cm in the anteroposterior and 4.4 cm in the mediolateral dimensions. The histological examination revealed a thermal injury pattern characterized by 3 distinct staining patterns in relation to the different zones of the lesion. This included a central necrotic zone (Zone 1) devoid of cells (Fig. a).
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Moving forward, we will continue to monitor your condition closely with regular MR imaging. If you experience any new symptoms or have concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

"Doctor: Hello there, can you please tell me why you have come in today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I'm a 13-year-old boy and I've been experiencing headaches, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 weeks.
Doctor: I see. Let's take a closer look at your condition. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your brain and spinal cord, which revealed a left cerebellar expansive lesion. However, there is no evidence of metastasis.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also conducted a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and fortunately, there is no evidence of dissemination. You underwent complete surgical resection as confirmed by postoperative imaging to remove the lesion.
Patient: So the surgery went well then?
Doctor: Yes, the surgery was successful. After that, we performed a histopathological analysis, including reticulin staining, which revealed a desmoplastic/nodular MB. There was no diffuse severe cytological anaplasia present.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: It means that the tumor is a specific type, and it's not as aggressive as some other types. We also performed complementary immunophenotypic characterization, which suggested a MB with SHH activation and TP53 wild-type. The nuclear INI-1 staining was preserved, and P53 immunostaining showed nuclear positivity only in a small proportion of the tumor cells.
Patient: Okay, I hope that's a good sign.
Doctor: Yes, it is. There was no evidence of MYCN or MYCC amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). We conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) over a panel of 50 genes using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, which revealed an IDH1 R132C mutation in 46% of cells.
Patient: What about the other genes?
Doctor: We repeated the NGS with a panel of 400 genes using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Comprehensive Cancer Panel, and it revealed IDH1 R132C mutation in 24% of cells, SMARCB1-R201G in 30% of cells, and CDH11-L625T in 26% of cells. The panel was tested on both tumor and normal tissue to confirm the somatic nature of the mutations.
Patient: Were there any other mutations detected?
Doctor: No, mutations in SMO, PTCH1, SUFU, and TP53 were not detected. The Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k) array revealed the highest resemblance to the methylation class MB, subclass SHH A (children and adult). The calibrated score further supported these findings.
Patient: So what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide any necessary follow-up care. Since the surgery was successful and the tumor type is less aggressive, there is reason to be optimistic about your prognosis.
Patient: Thank you, doctor, for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a 13-year-old boy, reports experiencing headaches, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 weeks. He has undergone a complete surgical resection of a left cerebellar expansive lesion.

Your anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer is positive at 80-fold dilution, and your platelet count is 22,000/μL. 
Patient: Hmm, that's a lot of numbers. What do they mean?
Doctor: These numbers suggest that there might be an issue with your liver. We also tested for hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus, all of which were negative. However, your anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) IgG was positive.
Patient: So, what's the issue with my liver?
Doctor: We performed abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography, which didn't reveal any significant biliary tract disease that could have led to liver damage. Based on the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Scoring System, your pretreatment clinical score without histology is 13. This indicates probable autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Your severe thrombocytopenia is likely due to concomitant immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) based on your clinical and laboratory findings.

Can you tell me about your medical history and any symptoms you've been experiencing lately?\nPatient: Well, I don't have any significant medical history. But for the past few days, I've been feeling general malaise and noticed some purpura on my legs. I haven't had a fever or any abdominal complaints though.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I also see that you have a history of alcohol intake, about 40g per day. Have you been taking any constant medications or drugs?\nPatient: No, I haven't been taking any drugs or medications.\nDoctor: Okay, let's review your vital signs and laboratory findings. Your vital signs are stable, but you have jaundice and purpura on your legs. The laboratory results show total bilirubin at 8.8 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 1,767 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 1,845 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase at 2,229 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 845 U/L, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 2,042 mg/dl. Your anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer is positive at 80-fold dilution, and your platelet count is 22,000/μL. \nPatient: Hmm, that's a lot of numbers. What do they mean?\nDoctor: These numbers suggest that there might be an issue with your liver. We also tested for hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus, all of which were negative. However, your anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) IgG was positive.\nPatient: So, what's the issue with my liver?\nDoctor: We performed abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography, which didn't reveal any significant biliary tract disease that could have led to liver damage. Based on the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Scoring System, your pretreatment clinical score without histology is 13. This indicates probable autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Your severe thrombocytopenia is likely due to concomitant immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) based on your clinical and laboratory findings.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We will need to perform a liver biopsy to get a clearer understanding of your condition. After that, we can discuss the appropriate treatment options for both autoimmune hepatitis and immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We will do our best to help you manage your condition.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're an 86-year-old white male ex-smoker with dyslipidemia. Can you tell me about your prior medical history?
Patient: Sure, I had neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve, prostatism, and nephrolithiasis. I also had a history of coronary artery disease.
Doctor: I see. You previously underwent cardiac catheterization in 1986, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. They found atheromatosis and 30% stenosis of my right coronary, circumflex, and anterior descending arteries.
Doctor: And you've had endovascular treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in 2010 and an aneurysm of the left internal iliac in 2014, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: In March 2016, did you experience progressive effort dyspnea?
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: You underwent cardiac catheterization for suspected non-angina myocardial ischemia. The results showed atheromatous lesions involving 50% of the proximal third of the anterior descending artery, 80% of the mid third, 30% of the proximal third of the circumflex artery, and 50% of the proximal third, 90% of the mid third, 50% of the distal third of the right coronary artery. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: After that, you had angioplasty conducted in two stages with a 2-week interval. Diagnostic catheterization and stent angioplasty were performed, with a total of three accesses, all via the left radial access, since the diagnostic procedure revealed occlusion of the right brachial artery related to prior catheterization. How did you feel after the angioplasty?
Patient: My symptoms improved significantly after the angioplasty.
Doctor: But a year after the intervention, you began experiencing dyspnea again, this time unrelated to effort. You underwent investigation again in March 2017. Do you recall the results of the electrocardiogram?
Patient: I think it showed a sinusoidal rhythm with a frequency of 57.
Doctor: Yes, and the stress echocardiogram with an ejection fraction at 55% did not reveal evidence of ischemia or fibrosis. Polysomnography found an apnea-hypopnea index of 3.8, with oxyhemoglobin saturation varying from 76 to 91% while asleep. Spirometry results showed forced vital capacity within expected limits and airflow mildly reduced, with significant variations on the bronchodilator test. Based on these findings, we'll work together to manage your symptoms and monitor your condition closely. It's important to follow up with regular appointments and report any new symptoms or changes.","S: The patient is an 86-year-old white male ex-smoker with a history of dyslipidemia, neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve, prostatism, nephrolithiasis, and coronary artery disease. He reports a history of progressive effort dyspnea starting in March 2016 and a recurrence of dyspnea unrelated to effort in 2017. He has undergone multiple cardiac interventions, including cardiac catheterization and angioplasty.
O: Past medical interventions include cardiac catheterization in 1986 revealing atheromatosis with 30% stenosis in multiple coronary arteries, endovascular treatment for abdominal and iliac artery aneurysms, and a more recent angioplasty with significant improvement in symptoms. Recent diagnostic tests showed a sinusoidal rhythm with a frequency of 57, a stress echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 55% without evidence of ischemia or fibrosis, and spirometry indicating mildly reduced airflow with significant variations on the bronchodilator test.
A: The primary diagnosis is chronic coronary artery disease with a history of multiple arterial aneurysms and interventions. Differential diagnoses include respiratory disorders as indicated by recent spirometry results. The patient's age and extensive cardiovascular history suggest a complex management scenario with a focus on symptom control and prevention of further cardiovascular events.
P: Continue regular follow-up appointments to monitor cardiovascular and respiratory status. Emphasize the importance of reporting new symptoms or changes in existing symptoms. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist given the spirometry results and potential underlying respiratory issues.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: I presented to the emergency room with sudden right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Doctor: I see. Let me perform a physical exam to check for any signs of appendicitis. Have you experienced any similar symptoms in the past?
Patient: Yes, five years ago I had diffuse abdominal pain and a CT scan identified a lesion in my small bowel. The endoscopic biopsy showed it was GIST.
Doctor: Did you undergo any treatment for that?
Patient: I had a resection without complications. No pathology was available, and according to me, no adjuvant chemotherapy was given. I was symptom-free for the next several years.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. I'll need to perform some tests to check for any signs of recurrence. In the meantime, I'll also check your white blood cell count.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
[later]
Doctor: Your white blood cell count is elevated at 16.5, and the CT scan shows signs of appendicitis as well as suspicious masses in the abdominal area. We'll need to consider nonoperative management and further workup. Let's have a discussion about the next steps.
Patient: What do you think might be happening?
Doctor: Based on the findings, the right lower quadrant masses are most concerning for recurrent GIST. We'll need to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm this and plan for surgery.
Patient: Okay, let's do the surgery.
[later, after surgery]
Doctor: I wanted to update you on the surgery. During the diagnostic laparoscopy, we found that the appendix wall was thickened and acutely inflamed with nodular lesions. We also found multiple nodules on the terminal ileum and the parietal peritoneum of the anterior and lateral abdominal walls.
Patient: Were you able to remove them all?
Doctor: We removed most of them, but one larger nodule in the right pelvis couldn't be mobilized. Due to the volume of the separate masses, we had to convert the case to a laparotomy. We made a lower midline incision, secured the mesoappendix with a stapler, and resected the appendix.
Patient: What about the other nodules and the terminal ileum?
Doctor: We removed all visible nodules from the peritoneum and performed a partial resection of the terminal ileum. We'll need to closely monitor your recovery and follow up with any additional treatments as necessary.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a previous GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) patient, presented with sudden right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. He reported a history of a similar episode five years ago, which led to the diagnosis and surgical resection of GIST.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're an 11-year-old female who presented to the emergency department and was admitted to the hospital in October 2016 with a 1-month history of extreme right lower extremity burning pain and seizure-like activity. Can you describe your symptoms and how frequently they occur?
Patient: Yeah, my right leg has been hurting really badly, and I have these seizure-like episodes. They've been happening like 25 to 30 times a day and last for 2 to 3 minutes each.
Doctor: I understand. The MRI of your back and leg were negative, except for inflammation noted in the ligaments around your right knee. We also performed an EEG because of the frequent seizure-like activity, but it was negative, so the diagnosis is pseudoseizures. We've tried treating your pain with several drugs, including Toradol, Motrin, Tylenol, Oxycontin, and even IV morphine. Have these medications provided any relief?
Patient: No, they haven't really helped with the pain or the seizures.
Doctor: I see. We also evaluated psychogenic causes and looked into your children's hospital records. They suggested reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which was considered due to alterations in the color and temperature of your right leg and evidence of inflammation in the peri-knee ligaments. Videos taken of you show severe pain and seizure activity. After 3 months of these unrelenting symptoms, you've come to my office. We've obtained informed consent to try ozone therapy using direct intravenous gas (DIV). We'll start with five treatments per week, for 26 weeks, totaling 120 treatments. You'll begin therapy at 5 cc gas at a concentration of 55 μg/cc and gradually increase to 30 cc at 55 μg/cc. 
Patient: Okay, I hope this helps.
Doctor: After about 10 sessions, we should see some improvement in your pain and a decrease in pseudoseizures from 25 to 30 per day to 12-15 per day, lasting half the previous average time of 2-3 minutes. 
Patient: That would be a relief.
Doctor: After 3 months, the pseudoseizures should become rare, and by the 4th month, they should stop completely, along with the clearance of all pain. You should be able to return to school symptom-free 1 year after it began and remain symptom-free since.
Patient: That would be amazing. I just want to get back to my normal life.
Doctor: I understand, and we'll do our best to help you achieve that. We'll monitor your progress throughout the ozone therapy treatments to ensure everything is going as planned.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.

"Doctor: Hi, I see from your history that you've had HTLV-1 infection for 20 years, along with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes type-2, peripheral vascular disease, chronic neck and back pain, and you've been nonambulatory for a year. You were admitted to the medical service due to dehydration and acute kidney injury. How have you been feeling lately?
Patient: I've been feeling really weak and experiencing worsening pain in my legs. I also have this strange tingling sensation.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We consulted neurology for your symptoms, and they performed a neurological examination to evaluate for HTLV-1 myelopathy, which can cause pain, stiffness, and gait problems. The examination showed a flat, mask-like face with a positive glabellar reflex. They also found decreased power bilaterally in your upper and lower extremities, brisk reflexes, and hypertonia. Can you tell me more about your muscle strength and any tremors you may have experienced?
Patient: Sure, my arm strength feels like it's 4 out of 5 and I've noticed some shaking when I try to do things. My leg strength is really low, maybe 2 out of 5.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. The examination also found brisk reflexes and bilateral clonus in your lower extremities, as well as bilaterally upgoing toes. The sensory examination was normal, but there was generalized diffuse rigidity. We performed some imaging tests, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of your brain, which showed bilateral basal ganglia calcifications and mild cortical atrophy. We also did magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain, which revealed low signal intensity from iron accumulation in the red nucleus and substantia nigra, as well as atrophy of the cerebral cortex and superior vermis of the cerebellum. The MRI of the thoracolumbar spine and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) were unremarkable.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also tested your serum for HTLV-1 antibody, which was positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and your glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibody was also positive at 8 IU/ml by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on the clinical evaluation, it appears that you have HTLV-1 related myelopathy with parkinsonism.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 58-year-old male with no past medical history. What brings you to the emergency department today?
Patient: Hi doc, I've been experiencing left lower extremity weakness for the past 30 minutes. All of a sudden, my leg just felt paralyzed, so I decided to come here for an evaluation.
Doctor: I understand. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
Patient: Hmm, now that you mention it, I've also been having central chest pain that seems to spread to my back. It started around the same time as the paralysis.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. And have you experienced any shortness of breath or other neurological deficits?
Patient: No, just the weakness in my leg and the chest pain.
Doctor: Alright. When you arrived at the emergency department, we noticed that you were pale, diaphoretic, and in acute distress. Your vital signs at the time were a pulse of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/97 millimeters of mercury in the right upper extremity, respirations of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, and an oral temperature of 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Doctor: Upon physical exam, we found bilateral diminished radial pulses and 0/5 strength in your left lower extremity. Your lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and there was no appreciable murmur. We didn't obtain a chest radiograph (CXR) at this time.
Doctor: We performed an electrocardiogram (ECG) which demonstrated an acute inferior and posterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This prompted us to activate a ""code STEMI."" However, before proceeding, we also performed a POCUS ultrasound.
Doctor: The ultrasound revealed right ventricle akinesis consistent with an acute MI and a dissection flap of the aortic arch. However, it was negative for pericardial effusion or tamponade. Based on these ultrasound findings and with cardiology at bedside, we decided to cancel the ""code STEMI.""
Doctor: Instead of percutaneous coronary intervention, we have decided that you need emergent cardiothoracic surgery. We immediately brought you to the radiology suite for an emergent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest and abdomen to further evaluate your condition.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a serious situation, and we are doing our best to provide you with the appropriate care.
Doctor: Unfortunately, while on the table prior to the imaging acquisition, you became bradycardic. We're monitoring you closely and will proceed with the necessary interventions as needed.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in this difficult situation.

He denies any history of similar symptoms, shortness of breath, or other neurological deficits.
O: On examination, the patient appeared pale, diaphoretic, and in acute distress. Vital signs showed a pulse of 74 bpm, BP 166/97 mmHg, RR 20 bpm, SpO2 97% on room air, and temperature 97.9°F.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you are a 48-year-old employed male, and you have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder. You were recently admitted to our inpatient psychiatric unit for the treatment of severe bipolar 1 depression. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. About two months ago, I was involuntarily hospitalized at another facility for mania.
Doctor: I see. Before your admission, we obtained standard laboratory measures, which were within normal limits, and a urine toxicology screen, which was negative. Can you tell me about your symptoms during the initial days on our service?
Patient: Sure. I was feeling really depressed and had low energy. I slept through the night and most of the day. I rarely attended group therapy or socialized with the staff or other patients.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We started you on modafinil 100 mg daily with plans to use it short term to help combat your hypersomnia. At that time, your psychiatric medications included divalproex 2,500 mg QHS, quetiapine 300 mg QHS, and venlafaxine 225 mg once daily. Venlafaxine had been increased to 225 mg several weeks prior to the initiation of modafinil. Your valproic acid level was 79 ug/ml, confirming adequate prophylactic treatment of mania. There were no other changes made to your medication regimen at this time. Did you notice any changes in your symptoms after we started the modafinil?
Patient: Yeah, two days after starting modafinil, I began to have some weird symptoms, like seeing trees moving in my bedroom and thinking there were cameras in the pictures on my wall. I also thought a water bottle was transmitting something into my room.
Doctor: I see. And did you experience any other psychotic behaviors during that time?
Patient: Yes, I woke up my roommate in the middle of the night, accusing him of abusing his daughter, and later, I accused the treatment team of including me in experimental research.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Following these psychotic events, we decided to discontinue the modafinil, and your psychotic features subsided within the following days. How are you feeling now?
Patient: I'm feeling much better now, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. If you have any concerns or notice any changes in your symptoms, please let us know immediately.
Patient: Okay, I will. Thank you for your help, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of bipolar 1 disorder, recently hospitalized for severe bipolar 1 depression. He reports experiencing significant depression, low energy, and hypersomnia, sleeping most of the day and night, with minimal participation in therapy or social interactions. He also experienced new onset psychotic symptoms, including visual hallucinations and delusions, after starting modafinil.
O: Laboratory measures and urine toxicology were within normal limits. The patient's medication regimen included modafinil 100 mg daily, divalproex 2,500 mg QHS, quetiapine 300 mg QHS, and venlafaxine 225 mg daily. Valproic acid level was 79 ug/ml, within the therapeutic range. Following the onset of psychotic symptoms, modafinil was discontinued, leading to a subsidence of these symptoms.
A: The primary diagnosis is severe bipolar 1 depression with a recent episode of drug-induced psychosis secondary to modafinil. The patient's psychotic symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of modafinil, supporting the diagnosis of medication-induced psychosis.
P: Continue monitoring the patient's mental health status and adjust the psychiatric medication regimen as necessary, excluding modafinil.

You were recently admitted to our inpatient psychiatric unit for the treatment of severe bipolar 1 depression. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. About two months ago, I was involuntarily hospitalized at another facility for mania.\nDoctor: I see. Before your admission, we obtained standard laboratory measures, which were within normal limits, and a urine toxicology screen, which was negative. Can you tell me about your symptoms during the initial days on our service?\nPatient: Sure. I was feeling really depressed and had low energy. I slept through the night and most of the day. I rarely attended group therapy or socialized with the staff or other patients.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. We started you on modafinil 100 mg daily with plans to use it short term to help combat your hypersomnia. At that time, your psychiatric medications included divalproex 2,500 mg QHS, quetiapine 300 mg QHS, and venlafaxine 225 mg once daily. Venlafaxine had been increased to 225 mg several weeks prior to the initiation of modafinil. Your valproic acid level was 79 ug/ml, confirming adequate prophylactic treatment of mania.

"Doctor: Hello, I have received your medical report from King Abdulaziz Medical City. You're a 64-year-old Caucasian male smoker with a history of open pyelolithotomy 18 years ago, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: It seems that you presented to the hospital with gross hematuria six months prior, which was treated as a urinary tract infection. Is that correct?
Patient: Yeah, I had blood in my urine, and they treated it as an infection.
Doctor: A CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis was performed, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The largest one is in the posterior part of the left renal artery, measuring 4.7 × 3.5 × 2.6 cm. There were also multiple stones found. Do you remember experiencing any pain or discomfort during that time?
Patient: Hmm, I think I did have some discomfort, but I don't remember the specifics.
Doctor: Your urine culture revealed various organisms isolated at 10-100,000 CFU/ml. The urinalysis showed a small amount of blood, a moderate presence of leukocytes, and a trace of protein. At the end of 2020, you underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it, along with satellite lesions. These findings likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain. Have you been experiencing any new symptoms or discomfort recently?
Patient: Yes, I've been having some lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain, along with hematuria and constipation.
Doctor: I see. The MRI also showed chronic pancreatitis with a dilated duct and stone. You were referred to the gastroenterology department for this issue. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to your pancreas?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything new or concerning.
Doctor: That's good to hear. A bone scan and chest CT were performed, and fortunately, no significant abnormality or metastasis was found. After a couple of days, you presented to the emergency department with non-radiating progressive lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain for three days, along with hematuria and constipation with fullness. You denied any history of fever or vomiting, and there were no other genitourinary symptoms, scrotal pain, or change in the level of consciousness. Your vital signs were measured and were as follows: blood pressure, 151/71 mmHg; heart rate, 109; respiratory rate, 20; and temperature, 37.1℃. How has your pain been since then?
Patient: It's been a bit better, but I still have some discomfort.
Doctor: Thank you for providing all of this information. It's important that we monitor your symptoms and follow up with the gastroenterology department for your pancreatitis. In the meantime, I recommend that you quit smoking and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle to minimize further complications. We will continue to evaluate your condition and determine the best course of action for your treatment.

Patient: Yeah, I can walk around just fine. It's a bit tough sometimes, but I manage.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Your FVC was 1.5 L or 96% predicted, which is a positive sign. Your ECHO was normal, and your cardiac MRI showed a normal LVEF. 
Patient: Oh, that's good news!
Doctor: Yes, it is. However, you had a nondisplaced Salter-Harris type II fracture of the distal left femur due to a fall, which required surgical fixation. You were discharged home on the day of the operation. How did that go?
Patient: The surgery went well, and I was able to go home the same day.
Doctor: Unfortunately, you presented to the emergency department two days after your operation with a seizure, tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever up to 38.6 degrees Celsius. You experienced progressive acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I was really scared when that happened.
Doctor: Shortly after intubation, you developed pulmonary hemorrhage and anemia. We treated this with fresh frozen plasma, ventilator adjustments, and blood transfusion. A fast spin MRI of your head came back negative. 
Patient: Oh, that's a relief.
Doctor: We also performed a CT scan of your chest, which demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates. Thankfully, no pulmonary embolism was identified. Your ECHO revealed mildly elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocities, representing increased right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures. 
Patient: What does that mean, doc?
Doctor: It means that there was some increased pressure in your heart and lungs, which could have contributed to your symptoms. We placed you on broad-spectrum antibiotics for 72 hours, but your blood, urine, and mini BAL tests remained negative.
Patient: So, what happened next?
Doctor: Mechanical ventilation was able to be weaned, and you were extubated on day five of your admission. You were then transferred to the pediatric floor and later discharged home without any residual effects from the entire event.
Patient: Wow, I'm glad that's all behind me now.

How have you been feeling lately?\nPatient: Hi, doc. I've been doing okay, I guess.\nDoctor: Let's talk about your growth first. You currently weigh 30 kg, which is at the 5.6th percentile, and you are 120 cm tall, which is less than the 3rd percentile. Despite this, you're able to ambulate without assistance. How does that feel?\nPatient: Yeah, I can walk around just fine. It's a bit tough sometimes, but I manage.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Your FVC was 1.5 L or 96% predicted, which is a positive sign. Your ECHO was normal, and your cardiac MRI showed a normal LVEF. \nPatient: Oh, that's good news!\nDoctor: Yes, it is. However, you had a nondisplaced Salter-Harris type II fracture of the distal left femur due to a fall, which required surgical fixation. You were discharged home on the day of the operation. How did that go?\nPatient: The surgery went well, and I was able to go home the same day.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, you presented to the emergency department two days after your operation with a seizure, tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever up to 38.6 degrees Celsius. You experienced progressive acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I was really scared when that happened.\nDoctor: Shortly after intubation, you developed pulmonary hemorrhage and anemia. We treated this with fresh frozen plasma, ventilator adjustments, and blood transfusion. A fast spin MRI of your head came back negative. \nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\nDoctor: We also performed a CT scan of your chest, which demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates. Thankfully, no pulmonary embolism was identified. Your ECHO revealed mildly elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocities, representing increased right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures. \nPatient: What does that mean, doc?\nDoctor: It means that there was some increased pressure in your heart and lungs, which could have contributed to your symptoms. We placed you on broad-spectrum antibiotics for 72 hours, but your blood, urine, and mini BAL tests remained negative.\nPatient: So, what happened next?\nDoctor: Mechanical ventilation was able to be weaned, and you were extubated on day five of your admission. You were then transferred to the pediatric floor and later discharged home without any residual effects from the entire event.\nPatient: Wow, I'm glad that's all behind me now.\nDoctor: Yes, it's great news that you've recovered well. Please continue to follow up with us regularly to monitor your condition and manage your DMD. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. \nPatient: Thank you, doc. I appreciate your help.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to me with a six-month history of medically refractory seizures. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing daily episodic paresthesias with phantosmia, and I also have a right-sided severe to profound mixed hearing loss.
Doctor: I understand. I also noticed in your medical history that you have chronic otitis media and had a right-sided tympanomastoidectomy 20 years prior. Have you been having any issues with your eustachian tube since then?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having ongoing problems with eustachian tube dysfunction.
Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any CSF rhinorrhea, otorrhea, or other symptoms related to your condition?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those issues.
Doctor: That's good to know. To further investigate your seizures, we've done a seizure workup which included a video EEG. It confirmed that your paresthesias and phantosmia are caused by right temporal lobe epilepsy. We also performed computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which demonstrated a right temporal lobe encephalocele.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: In addition to the TLE, the MRI showed increased edema and flair signal within your right mesial temporal lobe. We discussed your case at a multidisciplinary skull base conference, and the decision was made to proceed with a combined mastoid-middle cranial fossa encephalocele repair surgery. Informed consent was obtained from you prior to the surgery.
Patient: Yes, I remember.
Doctor: During the surgery, we repaired a 1 x 1 cm tegmen defect with the herniation of glial tissue into the mastoid. We performed a partial resection and used an Onlay dural substitute to fix the defect. Your postoperative course went smoothly.
Patient: That's good to hear. I did notice an improvement in my seizure frequency and duration after the surgery, but they haven't fully resolved.
Doctor: Yes, we've noticed that as well. A repeat 3T epilepsy protocol MRI showed further hippocampal atrophy, increased flair within the right hippocampus, and the loss of gray-white differentiation in the anterior temporal lobe. This has led us to diagnose you with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: On a retrospective neuroradiology review, we observed the progression of decreased hippocampal volume in your MRIs leading up to the surgery. Currently, we are working on a plan for the resection of the temporal epileptically focal lesion to better manage your condition.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having some pain in my kidney area and my doctor told me I might have a staghorn calculus.
Doctor: I see. Based on your condition, you might need a nephro-ureterostomy stent placement. This procedure will help alleviate your symptoms. We'll use fluoroscopic guidance to accurately place the stent.
Patient: Hmm, how does that work?
Doctor: First, we'll introduce a 21-gauge needle through your skin into an inferior renal calyx. Then, we'll perform an antegrade pyelogram to visualize the opacification of your collecting system.
Patient: Okay, and what happens after that?
Doctor: After demonstrating the return of urine, we'll pass a wire through the needle and introduce a dilator over the wire. We may use multiple catheters and wires to attempt to gain access to the collecting system.
Patient: Alright, and how long does the procedure usually take?
Doctor: It varies for each patient but could take around two hours. In some cases, we might have to abandon the procedure if we can't access the central renal pelvis due to the obstructive staghorn calculus. However, we'll do our best to ensure the procedure is successful.
Patient: I see. What other options do you have if the initial attempts don't work?
Doctor: We could use a SwiftNINJA® SMC catheter from Merit Medical Systems. It's designed to easily navigate around the staghorn calculus and eventually reach the proximal ureter.
Patient: That sounds like a good option.
Doctor: Yes, once we reach the ureter, we'll use a Platinum Plus™ guidewire from Boston Scientific to guide the SMC into the bladder. Then, we'll exchange the SMC for a 4-French Berenstein catheter and place an 8.5-French nephro-ureterostomy stent from Cook Medical.
Patient: And where will the stent be placed?
Doctor: The distal loop of the stent will be formed in your urinary bladder. However, due to the space-occupying staghorn calculus, we might be unable to form the proximal loop in the renal pelvis. But don't worry, we'll inject contrast through the stent to ensure proper flow.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining the procedure to me. I'm ready to move forward with the stent placement.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll schedule the procedure as soon as possible and provide you with all the necessary instructions for preparation and follow-up care.","S: The patient reports pain in the kidney area and has been informed by a previous doctor of a possible staghorn calculus.

"Doctor: Good morning! I see from your history that you're a 72-year-old female with hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and a 50 pack-year smoking history. Can you please describe the symptoms that brought you here today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Over the past 6 months, I've been experiencing a 30-pound weight loss, severe nausea, emesis, mild imbalance which gradually turned into bedbound instability, and involuntary body shakes.
Doctor: I understand that can be very concerning. I see that you've already had some tests done at an outside facility, including contrast-enhanced MRI imaging, EEG, colonoscopy, and basic hematologic and chemistry panels. It seems that all those tests came back normal. However, there were a few abnormal findings. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed possible gastritis; your thyroid stimulating hormone was mildly elevated at 9 U/mL, and your anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody was also elevated at 50 mg/L. Did you receive any treatment for these issues?
Patient: Yes, I was evaluated by a psychiatrist who prescribed sertraline and recommended relaxation techniques. But my family wanted me to get further evaluation, so I was transferred to your institution.
Doctor: I'm glad you came to us for further evaluation. During your physical exam here, we noticed disorganized high amplitude conjugate horizontal eye movements that persisted even with eye closure, severe truncal ataxia that prevented you from sitting up without support, and distinct abdominal myoclonus. However, your other neurological exam results, including your mental status, were unremarkable. We started you on symptomatic and empiric therapy with lorazepam, levetiracetam, and a 5-day course of high-dose IV methylprednisolone. How are you feeling now?
Patient: Hmm, I do feel a bit better, but I'm still struggling with some of my symptoms.
Doctor: I understand. We did some additional tests on your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with 25 WBCs, but an otherwise unremarkable profile. Cytology was negative for malignancy, and flow cytometry demonstrated a T cell dominant inflammatory process, believed to be reactive. Your paraneoplastic panel in the CSF was negative; however, we detected voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies (VGKC) in your serum at 0.05 nmol/L, which is above the normal range of <0.02 nmol/L.
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me, doctor?
Doctor: The elevated VGKC antibodies in your serum could be contributing to your symptoms. Unfortunately, we couldn't perform the CSF VGKC assay at our laboratory at the time of your evaluation. We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment accordingly. It's important to keep an open line of communication about your symptoms and how you're feeling.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through this process.","S: 72-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and a significant smoking history presents with a 6-month history of 30-pound weight loss, severe nausea, emesis, progressive imbalance leading to bedbound instability, and involuntary body shakes.

"Doctor: Hello, welcome to our institution. I understand you've been transferred here due to gastric cancer. Can you tell me about your symptoms and medical history?
Patient: Yes, I've had a history of black stools and anemia for about 3 years now. My past medical history includes multiple comorbidities like diabetes, chronic renal failure, alcoholic cirrhosis Child A, complete heart blockade, and thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We performed an upper endoscopy and biopsy which revealed a well-differentiated intestinal type adenocarcinoma in the antrum. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic, 3.2 cm neoplasm, without muscularis externa infiltration and reactive ganglia.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that we have identified a tumor in your stomach. Given the tumor size, stage, and your comorbidities, we chose endoscopic mucosal resection as the best treatment option. The tumor was fully resected without complications.
Patient: That's a relief. So, what happened after the procedure?
Doctor: During the procedure, the anesthesiologist had difficulty with ventilation and abdominal distention was observed. Your blood pressure was 128/91 mmHg and your heart rate was 70 bpm. We performed an endoscopic revision before finishing the procedure, but we didn't identify any macroscopic perforation.
Patient: So, what did you do next?
Doctor: We placed a nasogastric tube and instituted therapeutic strategies to improve abdominal-wall compliance, such as changes in ventilation parameters, nasogastric suction, changing your position to supine, and removal of any strap over the abdomen. A plain abdominal radiography in the operating room showed a massive pneumoperitoneum.
Patient: What did you decide to do after that?
Doctor: We decided on a nonsurgical management approach and took you to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measured by a trans-bladder catheter was 33 mmHg.
Patient: What happened in the ICU?
Doctor: Six hours after ending the procedure, you developed dyspnea and anuria, leading to a diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome. Given your worsening status, interventional radiology evaluated you. A CT scan confirmed the massive pneumoperitoneum without intraperitoneal extravasation of contrast.
Patient: What was the next step in my treatment?
Doctor: We performed a percutaneous decompression guided by CT scan using a pigtail catheter G14. Air was immediately released under pressure, which helped improve your symptoms and hemodynamic status. Diuresis returned after a few hours.
Patient: That sounds like it went well.

"Doctor: Hello, I see from your records that you were involved in a dirt bike accident. Can you tell me what happened and what kind of injuries you sustained?
Patient: Yeah, I had a pretty bad crash and ended up with a type II distal diaphyseal tibia fracture and a segmental fibula fracture. They checked my leg and found a 1 cm wound with some grass in it.
Doctor: It looks like they performed a neurovascular assessment and didn't find any deficits, which is good. And they did an initial inspection of your leg to assess the wound. Did they do any treatment at that point?
Patient: Yes, they cleaned the wound with irrigation and gave me IV cefazolin, gentamicin, and penicillin. They also applied a splint to my leg.
Doctor: Good, those initial treatments are important. I see that you underwent intraoperative irrigation and debridement within the first 24 hours, and they placed a suprapatellar IMN. How did you feel after the surgery?
Patient: I was okay at first. They gave me two doses of IV Ancef, and I was discharged with a nonweightbearing status on my injured leg.
Doctor: I understand that you started to develop progressive knee discomfort over time. Can you describe the symptoms and when they began?
Patient: Yeah, after about four weeks, I started to have severe pain in my knee. It got really swollen and red, and I could hardly move it.
Doctor: It appears that at that juncture, an examination identified a large knee effusion, erythema, and minimal tolerance for knee range-of-motion. They also inspected the fracture site and found mild erythema with serosanguinous drainage. They aspirated the knee and found cloudy yellow fluid. The analysis showed a white cell count of over 100,000 with 96% neutrophils, and the cultures grew gram-negative rods. Your care was then transferred to me. 
Patient: Yeah, that's when things started to get really serious.
Doctor: We decided to perform an I&D of the knee, fracture site, and intramedullary canal after removing the hardware. During the procedure, we found discolored fluid in the knee and palpable loculations in the suprapatellar pouch. We also found grass in the knee and at the fracture site. 
Patient: That must be why my knee was so infected.
Doctor: Yes, the grass likely contributed to the infection. We performed a synovectomy to remove the loculated tissue in the knee, and we extended the surgical footprint at the fracture site to allow for debridement of the bone and soft tissue. We removed nonviable skin, which resulted in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect directly over the anteromedial tibial fracture site. 
Patient: What is the next step in my treatment?
Doctor: We used a reamed irrigator aspirator (RIA) during the procedure, which will help with recovery. Going forward, we will closely monitor your healing process and address any complications that may arise. It's important that you continue to follow the nonweightbearing status on your injured leg and follow up with us regularly.
Patient: Okay, I understand. I'll make sure to follow your instructions and come in for regular check-ups.
Doctor: Great, that's very important for your recovery. We'll do our best to get you back on your feet as soon as possible.","S: The patient reports a history of a dirt bike accident resulting in a type II distal diaphyseal tibia fracture and a segmental fibula fracture. He mentions initial treatment included wound irrigation and administration of IV cefazolin, gentamicin, and penicillin, followed by splint application. Post-surgery, he experienced progressive knee discomfort starting about four weeks after the incident, characterized by severe pain, swelling, redness, and restricted movement.
O: Initial assessments revealed a 1 cm wound with foreign material (grass) and no neurovascular deficits. Postoperative treatment included intraoperative irrigation, debridement, and placement of a suprapatellar intramedullary nail (IMN). Follow-up examinations showed a large knee effusion, erythema, and limited knee range-of-motion. Aspiration of the knee yielded cloudy yellow fluid with a white cell count over 100,000 and 96% neutrophils; cultures grew gram-negative rods. Surgical findings included discolored fluid in the knee, palpable loculations, and grass at the fracture site. A synovectomy and extended debridement were performed, resulting in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect over the anteromedial tibial fracture site.
A: The primary diagnosis is postoperative infection of the knee and tibia fracture site, likely exacerbated by foreign material (grass) contamination. Differential diagnoses could include non-infectious inflammatory response; however, the presence of high white cell counts and positive cultures confirm infection. The prognosis depends on effective management of the infection and proper wound healing.

Patient: Yes, I can follow commands without any problem.
Doctor: Great. We conducted a pulmonary function test, and the results indicated an obstructive pattern. Are you aware of this?
Patient: Yes, I remember being told about that.
Doctor: Alright. We performed a total hip arthroplasty using the same anesthetic regimen used for the first patient. During the surgery, while ventilating at an FiO2 of 0.4, you experienced hypoxia.

Patient: Hmm, I don't recall any specific feeling, but it was a bit uncomfortable at times.
Doctor: I see. We administered a muscle relaxant-reversing agent which helped you recover spontaneous respiration. Your O2 saturation level improved from 81% to 88%. We then applied continuous positive airway pressure, and your O2 saturation level further improved to 90%. After the surgery, your O2 saturation level increased to 98%. How are you feeling now?
Patient: I feel much better now, thank you.
Doctor: That's good to know. I want to inform you that neither you nor the first patient developed any respiratory complications after the surgery. The postoperative chest X-ray showed no notable findings for the first patient. However, in your case, it showed subsegmental atelectasis on the right middle lobe compared to the preoperative findings. We will monitor this closely and take necessary actions if needed.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you're here for a follow-up visit, have you been experiencing any new or concerning symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been having a painful, enlarging lump in my left breast for some time now.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me perform a clinical examination to better understand the issue. Hmm, I can feel a pulsatile mass with a continuous machinery murmur in the outer upper quadrant of your left breast. We'll need to do a Color Doppler imaging to get a clearer picture of the lump. 
Patient: Okay, sure.
Doctor: Based on the Color Doppler imaging, we found an anechoic lump measuring 45 × 26 × 33 mm, fed by an afferent artery. It shows a yin-yang appearance and a biphasic ""to-and-fro"" pattern. There's also a fistula situated 3-mm proximal to the anechoic lump, connecting the afferent artery and a concomitant vein. 
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Based on these findings, you've been diagnosed with breast PA-AVF. Don't worry, we'll take good care of you. We've consulted with a multidisciplinary team and determined that the lesion poses a risk of rupture. It's recommended that the lesion be excised and ligated under local anesthesia as soon as possible.
Patient: I see. How will the procedure be done?
Doctor: We'll make a 3-mm operative incision along the direction of the vascular route under ultrasonography guidance. The incision will be at the 1 o'clock position, 7 cm from the nipple, and it'll be concealed to prevent any cosmetic defect. We'll then ligate the proximal and distal artery and vein of the PA-AVF and excise it.
Patient: Is the surgery complicated?
Doctor: No, the entire operation is quite simple and time-efficient. The mean bleeding volume is only 5 mL, so it's relatively safe.
Patient: That's reassuring. When can we schedule the surgery?
Doctor: We can schedule it as soon as possible. Let's discuss the available dates and make an appointment.

Doctor: How are you feeling since the surgery? Any complications or concerns?
Patient: I feel much better, and the wound seems to have healed well.
Doctor: That's great to hear! Let's perform an ultrasonography to confirm the disappearance of the breast PA-AVF. Yes, the ultrasonography confirms that the breast PA-AVF has disappeared. The surgery was successful, and you should continue to heal well.

There\'s also a fistula situated 3-mm proximal to the anechoic lump, connecting the afferent artery and a concomitant vein. \nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, you\'ve been diagnosed with breast PA-AVF. Don\'t worry, we\'ll take good care of you. We\'ve consulted with a multidisciplinary team and determined that the lesion poses a risk of rupture. It\'s recommended that the lesion be excised and ligated under local anesthesia as soon as possible.\nPatient: I see. How will the procedure be done?\nDoctor: We\'ll make a 3-mm operative incision along the direction of the vascular route under ultrasonography guidance. The incision will be at the 1 o\'clock position, 7 cm from the nipple, and it\'ll be concealed to prevent any cosmetic defect. We\'ll then ligate the proximal and distal artery and vein of the PA-AVF and excise it.\nPatient: Is the surgery complicated?\nDoctor: No, the entire operation is quite simple and time-efficient. The mean bleeding volume is only 5 mL, so it\'s relatively safe.\nPatient: That\'s reassuring. When can we schedule the surgery?\nDoctor: We can schedule it as soon as possible.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having blurred vision for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about any medical history or surgeries you've had recently?
Patient: Yes, I had a laparoscopic myomectomy about eight months ago.
Doctor: How did you feel after the procedure?
Patient: Well, two months after the surgery, I started having abdominal pain and hardness over my anterior abdominal wall. So, I went to see my gynecologist.
Doctor: What did they find?
Patient: They did an ultrasound examination and an MRI study which showed fluid collections along the subcutaneous and muscular plane with adjacent subcutaneous edema.
Doctor: Did they perform any additional tests?
Patient: Yes, they did a fine needle aspiration cytology and the tissue sample revealed a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of likely mycobacterial origin.
Doctor: What treatment were you given for that?
Patient: I was started on an antituberculous regimen consisting of rifampicin (450 mg/day), ethambutol (800 mg/day), and clarithromycin (1000 mg/day) to cover possible atypical mycobacteria.
Doctor: When did you first notice the blurring and haziness in your eyes?
Patient: I started experiencing it five months after starting the regimen.
Doctor: Did you consult an ophthalmologist about this?
Patient: Yes, I did. They said my visual acuities were 6/6 bilaterally, my anterior segments and fundi appeared normal, and my color vision was normal on Ishihara plates.
Doctor: What did they recommend?
Patient: They discontinued my ethambutol as a precautionary measure, but my symptoms persisted, so I sought a second opinion.
Doctor: What were the findings of the second examination?
Patient: My visual acuity was 6/12 in both eyes, and everything else appeared normal, including pupillary reactions. I underwent baseline perimetry which revealed central bitemporal hemianopia that respected the vertical midline, consistent with ethambutol toxicity.
Doctor: I understand. It seems that ethambutol toxicity is the cause of your vision problems. We will discontinue the ethambutol treatment and I advise you to undergo regular follow-up with your primary physician.
Patient: Okay, thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. At your last follow-up, how was your vision?
Patient: A month later, I was visually asymptomatic and my visual acuities were back to 6/6 bilaterally.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Did you have any further field testing?
Patient: No, I declined further field testing.
Doctor: Alright. Please continue to monitor your vision and consult your primary physician if you have any concerns. Take care.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a 34-year-old female, reports experiencing blurred vision for approximately one month. She has a medical history of undergoing a laparoscopic myomectomy eight months ago, followed by the development of abdominal pain and hardness. An MRI and ultrasound post-surgery revealed fluid collections and subcutaneous edema. A fine needle aspiration indicated necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of likely mycobacterial origin. She was treated with an antituberculous regimen including rifampicin, ethambutol, and clarithromycin. The blurred vision began five months after starting this regimen.

Patient: What does that all mean?
Doctor: These numbers indicate that you have an underlying infection, so we started you on broad-spectrum antibiotics. You were admitted for treatment of pneumonia and further pulmonary evaluation.
Patient: And what about the biopsy?
Doctor: We performed an endobronchial ultrasound with a biopsy of the level 4L, 7, and 11R lymph nodes. The biopsy revealed tumor cells that were positive for S100 and HMB45 and negative for CK7, CK20, P63, TTF1, and napsin-A. This is consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.
Patient: Oh no, that's terrible news.

"Doctor: Hello, Case 1. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been feeling really weak and tired lately. I also have pain in my arms and legs, my face looks kind of blue, and I have a fever.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history? Have you had any surgeries or major health issues in the past?
Patient: Yes, I had a splenectomy after an accident a while back.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm going to start you on an empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone (2 g every 12h) and vancomycin (500 mg every 6h). We'll need to run some tests to find out what's causing your symptoms.
Patient: Okay, thank you, Doctor.
(After the tests and analysis)
Doctor: We've received the results of your tests. It appears that you have secondary sepsis caused by meningitis from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We'll be transferring you to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and treatment. Your clinical status has deteriorated, and you're experiencing severe hemodynamic instability, requiring vasopressor support with norepinephrine 0.4 μg/kg/min. You also have persistent hypotension and a pronounced inflammatory state with C-reactive protein (CRP) at 176.3 mg/l and procalcitonin (PCT) at 485.88 ng/ml.
Patient: Wow, that's a lot to take in.
Doctor: I understand. Additionally, you have metabolic abnormalities with lactate levels at 7.8 mmol/l and severe coagulative disorders. Due to your persistent anuria, we'll be starting continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), in the form of hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF, Prismaflex, M150, Baxter, USA), along with a Cytosorb cartridge. This treatment will begin within 24 hours of your ICU admission and will last for a total of 68 hours.
Patient: Will that help me feel better?
Doctor: Yes, we expect to see an improvement during the first treatment. Your PCT should reduce to 6 ng/ml by the end of the treatments, and your CRP should drop to 136.41 mg/l. Your lactate acidosis should also improve, with lactate levels decreasing to 1.9 mmol/dl.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Additionally, we should see stabilization in your hemodynamic condition, with a reduction in the need for norepinephrine. After 12 days, we'll stop the CRRT, and you should see a recovery in your diuresis.
Patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. The next steps will include monitoring your lactate, PCT, and norepinephrine demand during the Cytosorb treatment. We'll do our best to help you recover as quickly as possible.

Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was diagnosed with pseudoxanthoma elasticum and I've been experiencing some issues with my vision.
Doctor: I see. Can you please tell me more about the visual symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Sure, I've been having blurry vision in my left eye and it's been affecting my daily activities.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. I can see from your records that you were diagnosed with bilateral AS and CNV secondary to AS in your left eye. You were treated with 12 intravitreal injections of ranibizumab over 13 months. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I also noticed that despite the intensive treatment with ranibizumab, there wasn't any significant functional or anatomic change. One month after the last administration, your best-corrected visual acuity was 10/10 in your right eye and remained stable at 3/10 in your left eye. Fundoscopy demonstrated the peau d'orange fundus appearance and AS as multiple irregular linear branching subretinal streaks. An elevated gray-yellow subretinal lesion compatible with CNV was observed in your left eye, adjacent to a large fibrotic lesion. Do you remember having a fluorescein angiography test done?
Patient: Yes, I remember having that test.
Doctor: The test clearly showed streaks around the optic disc and leakage of the dye originating from the CNV, while staining of the fibrotic element of the foveal lesion was observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging also revealed signs of active CNV in your left eye with intraretinal and subretinal fluid accumulation. At that point, it was agreed to switch your treatment to aflibercept, using the proposed treatment regimen for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Do you recall signing an informed consent form for this new treatment?
Patient: Yes, I do remember signing the consent form.
Doctor: Great. You received a loading dose consisting of 3 consecutive intravitreal injections of aflibercept (2 mg [50 µL]) monthly, followed by bimonthly aflibercept administration at the same dose. How has your vision been since starting this new treatment?
Patient: Actually, I've noticed some improvement in my left eye.
Doctor: That's good to hear. The 3 loading doses of aflibercept led to an improved best-corrected visual acuity of 6/10 in your left eye. The OCT also demonstrated resolution of the subretinal fluid with a reduction of the intraretinal fluid. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment as necessary. Please make sure to schedule regular follow-up appointments so we can keep an eye on your condition.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having this cough for three months now. I haven't traveled outside Djibouti, and I don't have any medical, surgical, or tuberculosis history.
Doctor: I see. Let's do a chest radiograph and some tests to determine the cause of your cough. We'll also test you for HIV.
(After receiving the test results)
Doctor: Your chest radiograph shows a retractile opacity in the right upper lobe of your lung and a para-aortic opacity with micronodules of the culmen. Your HIV test came back negative, which is good news. We also conducted a direct microscopic examination of your sputum smear after Ziehl-Neelsen staining, and it exhibited acid-fast bacilli. However, your sputum was not cultured.
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean, doc?
Doctor: Based on these findings, I'm diagnosing you with pulmonary tuberculosis. We will start you on first-line antituberculosis drugs to treat your condition.
Patient: Okay, thank you.

Patient: Hi, doc. I'm back, but my symptoms haven't improved. My cough is still persistent.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's perform another direct examination of your sputum and a GeneXpert® MTB/RIF lab test to check for any changes.
(After receiving the test results)
Doctor: Your sputum examination came back positive, and we detected a rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis complex isolate. We'll need to hospitalize you and change your treatment plan.
Patient: Alright, what's the new treatment plan?
Doctor: We'll be treating you with daily doses of kanamycin (1 g), moxifloxacin (400 mg), prothionamide (250 mg), clofazimine (100 mg), isoniazid (300 mg), ethionamide (250 mg), and pyrazinamide (400 mg). The doses will be adjusted according to your weight.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
(After a few months of treatment)
Doctor: Your recent sputum culture came back positive, yielding strain 5175, which was identified as an M. tuberculosis complex isolate. However, your symptoms seem to have improved, which is a good sign.
Patient: That's great to hear! Thank you, doc.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me your past medical history?
Patient: Yeah, I have hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60%, acute pancreatitis, and I had a cholecystectomy in the 1990s.
Doctor: I see. What brings you here today?
Patient: I've been having severe epigastric pain for a day now. It's constant, like 10 out of 10 in severity, and it's radiating to my back. I also have severe nausea, nonbloody nonbilious vomiting, and anorexia.
Doctor: When did these symptoms start?
Patient: They began three days after I started taking metronidazole for C. difficile colitis, which I developed after being treated with antibiotics for cellulitis.
Doctor: Do you have any history of alcohol use, hypertriglyceridemia, recent flu-like illness, travel to parasite endemic areas, direct trauma, lupus, vasculitis, or other autoimmune diseases?
Patient: No, I don't have any of those.
Doctor: What about a family history of pancreatitis or a recent history of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography?
Patient: No, none of those either.
Doctor: Do you smoke?
Patient: Yes, I have a 20 pack-year smoking history.
Doctor: Can you please tell me your current medications?
Patient: I take albuterol, alprazolam, atorvastatin, clonidine, fluticasone-salmeterol, losartan, loratadine, montelukast, and omeprazole.
Doctor: Thank you. At presentation, your vital signs were stable. During the physical exam, we found a distended abdomen with severe epigastric tenderness and diminished bowel sounds, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No other abnormal findings were noted.
Doctor: Your lab results on admission showed a white blood cell count of 16,000/μL with neutrophilic predominance and no eosinophilia. Lipase was >396 U/L, but amylase was not measured. Liver function tests were mildly elevated with total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 59 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 135 IU/L. Calcium level was 8.6 mg/dL, and triglycerides level was 69 mg/dL.
Patient: What does all that mean?
Doctor: These findings suggest that your severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting are likely related to your acute pancreatitis. The elevated lipase and liver function tests support this diagnosis.
Patient: What should I do now?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and provide appropriate treatment for your acute pancreatitis. It's important to follow up with your primary care physician and discuss any changes in your medications, as well as addressing your smoking history. Ensure you keep track of your symptoms and report any worsening or new issues.","S: Patient reports severe epigastric pain rated 10/10, radiating to the back, with onset three days after starting metronidazole for C. difficile colitis.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I'm a 73-year-old female smoker. I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing right-sided inguinal pain and difficulties in passing urine for the past 2 days.
Doctor: I see. Have you had any medical issues in the past?
Patient: Yes, I had pancreatic cancer and underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy in 2005.
Doctor: Okay. Have you had any fever recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any fever.
Doctor: Upon examination, I found a 3-cm palpable aching mass in your right inguinal/femoral region. There's no apparent erythema or other signs of infection in the cutaneous region overlying the mass. Your CRP and WBC are normal, at 1.8 mg/L and 4.4 × 109/L, respectively. We performed a CT scan and it revealed a suspected femoral hernia with adjacent inflammation and a tubular structure, presumed to be the vermiform appendix, in the hernia-sack. There were no radiological signs of small bowel obstruction.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What's the next step?
Doctor: We're going to administer preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, including metronidazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. You'll then undergo open preperitoneal surgery to reposition the hernia.
Patient: And what will happen during the surgery?
Doctor: During the surgery, the peritoneum will be opened and we'll find the inflamed, but not perforated, appendix in the hernia. There will be no signs of bowel obstruction. After the appendectomy, we'll place a partially absorbable lightweight mesh (Ultrapro®) and adhere it with fibrin glue to cover the inguinal and femoral region.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: Postoperative clinical examination of the appendix will reveal a transmural inflammation in the distal third of the appendix. No macroscopic tumor will be present. You'll be discharged the day after surgery.
Patient: That's good to hear. But what if something goes wrong after I'm discharged?
Doctor: You'll actually be readmitted 4 days after surgery due to constipation. A surgical-site seroma will develop, but it will be treated conservatively. All of your symptoms will resolve 4 weeks after surgery.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll monitor your progress and make sure you're on the right track to recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.","S: The patient is a 73-year-old female smoker presenting with right-sided inguinal pain and difficulties in passing urine for the past 2 days.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing purpura, central obesity, facial plethora, and hypertension. I think I might have Cushing's syndrome.
Doctor: Based on your presentation, it is possible that you have Cushing's syndrome. We'll need to run some tests to confirm this.
Patient: Okay, what kind of tests?
Doctor: We'll check for ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, which could be due to a pituitary tumor. In your case, your symptoms and test results confirmed ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, likely of pituitary etiology. 
Patient: Oh wow, so what's the next step?
Doctor: The next step was a transsphenoidal surgery to remove the tumor. During your first surgery, the tumor was visualized but no sample was obtained for pathological analysis.
Patient: Yeah, I remember that. So what happened after that?
Doctor: With persistent postoperative hypercortisolism, a repeat transsphenoidal surgery was completed two months later. This time, a corticotroph adenoma was confirmed on pathology.
Patient: But I still felt off after the second surgery...
Doctor: Yes, you remained hypercortisolemic after the second surgery. One year later, we started you on cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly for persistent and moderately elevated 24-hour UFC levels.
Patient: Oh, I see. But I had to stop taking the medication for a while...
Doctor: At age 54, during a period of medication nonadherence, your 24-hour UFC increased to twice normal. Two months later, you presented to the hospital with a three-day history of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
Patient: Yeah, the pain was really bad.
Doctor: A CT scan of your abdomen showed a large collection of stool and gas centrally in the mesentery, on the background of multiple diverticulae. Surgery was needed to address this issue.
Patient: What did the surgery find?
Doctor: During the surgery, a 1.5 × 3 cm perforation of the sigmoid colon was found, with features more consistent with a perforated stercoral ulcer rather than a diverticular perforation. A distal sigmoidectomy with the creation of an end colostomy was performed.
Patient: I'm glad that was taken care of. How am I doing now?
Doctor: You're doing well and have remained eucortisolemic on cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly. It's important to continue taking your medication as prescribed and follow up with regular check-ups.
Patient: Thank you, doctor! I'll make sure to adhere to my medication and follow-up appointments.","S: The patient reports experiencing purpura, central obesity, facial plethora, and hypertension. He suspects he might have Cushing's syndrome. He recalls undergoing two transsphenoidal surgeries for a pituitary tumor, with the second surgery confirming a corticotroph adenoma. Despite surgeries, he remained hypercortisolemic and was started on cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly. He admits to a period of medication nonadherence at age 54, which was followed by severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
O: The patient's initial symptoms and subsequent test results confirmed ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome of pituitary etiology. Postoperative persistence of hypercortisolism was noted. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large collection of stool and gas in the mesentery with multiple diverticulae. Surgery identified a 1.5 × 3 cm perforation of the sigmoid colon, managed by distal sigmoidectomy and creation of an end colostomy. Current medication includes cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly, with recent lab tests indicating eucortisolemia.
A: The primary diagnosis is Cushing's syndrome due to a pituitary corticotroph adenoma, complicated by postoperative persistent hypercortisolism and a significant episode of sigmoid colon perforation secondary to stercoral ulcer. Differential diagnosis initially included other causes of Cushing's syndrome.
P: Continue cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly to manage Cushing's syndrome. Emphasize the importance of medication adherence to prevent recurrence of hypercortisolism and associated complications. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor cortisol levels and overall health status. Educate the patient on the signs of cortisol imbalance and when to seek immediate medical attention.

I think I might have Cushing's syndrome.\nDoctor: Based on your presentation, it is possible that you have Cushing's syndrome. We'll need to run some tests to confirm this.\nPatient: Okay, what kind of tests?\nDoctor: We'll check for ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, which could be due to a pituitary tumor. In your case, your symptoms and test results confirmed ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, likely of pituitary etiology. \nPatient: Oh wow, so what's the next step?\nDoctor: The next step was a transsphenoidal surgery to remove the tumor. During your first surgery, the tumor was visualized but no sample was obtained for pathological analysis.\nPatient: Yeah, I remember that. So what happened after that?\nDoctor: With persistent postoperative hypercortisolism, a repeat transsphenoidal surgery was completed two months later. This time, a corticotroph adenoma was confirmed on pathology.\nPatient: But I still felt off after the second surgery...\nDoctor: Yes, you remained hypercortisolemic after the second surgery. One year later, we started you on cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly for persistent and moderately elevated 24-hour UFC levels.\nPatient: Oh, I see. But I had to stop taking the medication for a while...\nDoctor: At age 54, during a period of medication nonadherence, your 24-hour UFC increased to twice normal. Two months later, you presented to the hospital with a three-day history of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain.\nPatient: Yeah, the pain was really bad.\nDoctor: A CT scan of your abdomen showed a large collection of stool and gas centrally in the mesentery, on the background of multiple diverticulae. Surgery was needed to address this issue.\nPatient: What did the surgery find?\nDoctor: During the surgery, a 1.5 × 3 cm perforation of the sigmoid colon was found, with features more consistent with a perforated stercoral ulcer rather than a diverticular perforation. A distal sigmoidectomy with the creation of an end colostomy was performed.\nPatient: I'm glad that was taken care of. How am I doing now?\nDoctor: You're doing well and have remained eucortisolemic on cabergoline 1 mg twice weekly. It's important to continue taking your medication as prescribed and follow up with regular check-ups.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor! I'll make sure to adhere to my medication and follow-up appointments.""}

"Doctor: Hello, welcome to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics at SGT Dental College. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing severe pain in my right lower back tooth region for the last three days. The pain comes and goes, but it gets worse when I eat or drink something hot.
Doctor: I see. Let's do a clinical evaluation to find out what's causing the pain. 
(After evaluation)
Doctor: It appears that you have secondary caries associated with your restored right mandibular first molar. We'll need to take a diagnostic radiograph to get a better view.
(After radiograph)
Doctor: The radiograph shows restoration close to the pulp and the presence of an additional root. We took another radiograph at 30-degree mesial and distal angulation to confirm this. We'll need to perform an access cavity preparation under local anesthesia using an endo access bur from Dentsply, Switzerland.
Patient: Okay, what's the next step after that?
Doctor: We'll locate the first distal canal towards the buccal side, which indicates the presence of one additional canal on the lingual side. The shape of the access cavity will be modified from triangular to trapezoidal to locate the fourth canal. A DG-16 endodontic explorer will be used to locate the root canal orifices, and a 15 # K-file from Mani, Japan will be used to establish patency of the canals.
Patient: Got it. How do you determine the working length?
Doctor: We'll determine the working length using an apex locator, Root ZX from J. Morita, and reconfirm it radiographically. Biomechanical preparation will be done with a rotary ProTaper Next file system from Dentsply, Switzerland.
Patient: What will you use for irrigation during the procedure?
Doctor: During instrumentation, we'll use 1.3% sodium hypochlorite as an irrigant and 17% EDTA as the final flush.
Patient: And how will you perform the obturation?
Doctor: We'll perform the obturation with gutta-percha points using a cold lateral condensation technique. After that, we'll restore the access cavity with composite resin from Tetric-N-Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent, and take a post-obturation radiograph.
Patient: So, what can I expect after the treatment?
Doctor: At your 6-month follow-up, you should be asymptomatic and free of pain. Radiographic evaluation should show no evidence of pathology.
Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask. We're here to help you.","S: The patient reports severe pain in the right lower back tooth region, specifically the right mandibular first molar, which has been persistent for three days.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain that's been going on for one night. This pain has been causing you difficulty with sleeping and walking, is that correct?
Patient: Yeah, that's right. It's been really hard to get any rest or move around.
Doctor: Have you experienced any loss of appetite, vomiting, or fever along with this pain?
Patient: No, I haven't lost my appetite or been vomiting, but I did have a fever earlier.
Doctor: I noticed that you had an appendectomy 19 months ago due to similar symptoms and were diagnosed with appendicitis. Were there any complications during or after that surgery?
Patient: No, there weren't any problems during or after the surgery.
Doctor: Have you had a bowel movement in the last few days?
Patient: Hmm, now that you mention it, I haven't had one for several days.
Doctor: When you first arrived, we performed a physical examination and found signs of fever and localized peritonitis. Your lab results showed leukocytosis of 13,300 per cubic millimeter, which is above the reference range of 4,500-13,000, and neutrophilia of 9,870 per cubic millimeter, also above the reference range of 1,700-7,500. Your C-reactive peptide was elevated at 1.4 milligrams per deciliter, with the normal range being below 0.5. After giving you antipyretics, your fever has reduced, but you're still experiencing severe abdominal pain.
Patient: That's correct, the pain is still really bad.
Doctor: We also did a point-of-care ultrasound, which showed a normal gallbladder and no dilation of the common bile duct. However, it did demonstrate an aperistaltic mass in your right lower quadrant.
Patient: Oh, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means there's an abnormal mass in that area. After consulting with the pediatric surgery team, we performed a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis. This showed surgical changes from your previous appendectomy with staple lines at the blind end of the appendiceal stump. There was also a high-density appendicolith obstructing the base of the stump, surrounded by mesenteric fat stranding. Thickening of the appendiceal wall and peritoneal reflection of the right lower quadrant were found, which are consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no pneumoperitoneum.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We've admitted you to the hospital and you'll be undergoing laparoscopic surgery tomorrow. Surgical exploration will be done to address the inflamed appendiceal stump and the pus found in your right paracolic gutter.
Patient: And will that fix the issue?
Doctor: Yes, the surgery should help resolve the inflammation and pain. However, the appendiceal wall is very friable, so the surgeon will need to be cautious during the procedure. We'll continue to monitor your condition and provide appropriate care after the surgery.","S: The patient, a 19-month post-appendectomy individual, presented with severe abdominal pain persisting for one night, causing difficulty in sleeping and walking. The patient reported a fever but no loss of appetite or vomiting. The patient also noted an absence of bowel movements for several days.
O: Physical examination revealed fever and localized peritonitis. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (13,300 per cubic millimeter) and neutrophilia (9,870 per cubic millimeter), both above normal ranges. C-reactive peptide was elevated at 1.4 mg/dL. Point-of-care ultrasound showed a normal gallbladder and no common bile duct dilation but revealed an aperistaltic mass in the right lower quadrant. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis indicated surgical changes from a previous appendectomy, an obstructing high-density appendicolith at the appendiceal stump, surrounded by mesenteric fat stranding, and thickening of the appendiceal wall consistent with acute appendicitis.

A: The primary diagnosis is stump appendicitis with an obstructing appendicolith and associated inflammation. Differential diagnosis could include other causes of right lower quadrant pain, but imaging and history strongly support the primary diagnosis. The prognosis is good with appropriate surgical intervention, though caution is advised due to the friability of the appendiceal wall.

However, it did demonstrate an aperistaltic mass in your right lower quadrant.\nPatient: Oh, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means there's an abnormal mass in that area. After consulting with the pediatric surgery team, we performed a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis. This showed surgical changes from your previous appendectomy with staple lines at the blind end of the appendiceal stump. There was also a high-density appendicolith obstructing the base of the stump, surrounded by mesenteric fat stranding. Thickening of the appendiceal wall and peritoneal reflection of the right lower quadrant were found, which are consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no pneumoperitoneum.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We've admitted you to the hospital and you'll be undergoing laparoscopic surgery tomorrow.

"Doctor: Good morning. I see you have a past medical history of hypertension. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing lately?
Patient: Well, about a week after I had a respiratory viral infection, I started to develop some progressive cerebellar ataxia. I've been having trouble speaking clearly and my walking has become unsteady.
Doctor: I see. How long have your symptoms worsened?
Patient: They got worse for about 2 weeks and then remained stable.
Doctor: When were you admitted to our service?
Patient: I was admitted a year after my symptoms started.
Doctor: It seems that you were previously diagnosed with parainfectious cerebellar ataxia. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
Patient: Yes, I've had daily nausea and vomiting for the past 6 months, I lost 66 pounds, and I've been feeling tingling in my hands and feet.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's discuss the results of your neurological examination. It revealed severe dysarthria, bilateral horizontal nystagmus, pronounced ataxia, and bilateral dysdiadochokinesia. You're unable to stand or walk unattended, but there's no muscle weakness. We also observed generalized hypotonia, and your deep tendon reflexes were normal in the upper limbs and absent in the lower limbs.
Patient: Hmm, I see. What about the other tests?
Doctor: There was distal pinprick hypoesthesia in both your upper and lower limbs, with reduced proprioception and vibration sense in the lower limbs. Your cognition is preserved, and you reported no mood complaints. You also denied having any bowel or bladder dysfunction. Your blood exams were unremarkable.
Patient: What did the electromyography reveal?
Doctor: The electromyography showed severe axonal sensitive polyneuropathy in all four limbs, with mild motor involvement.
Patient: And what treatment have I been given?
Doctor: You were prescribed high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g qd for 3 days based on the hypothesis of an auto-immune condition. However, there was no clinical improvement. We also performed serological screening, including protein electrophoresis, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgG and IgA, anti-gliadin IgA, IgG, IgM, and anti-GAD, but the results were non-reactive.
Patient: Did you test for any other conditions?
Doctor: Yes, we tested for paraneoplastic antibodies, including anti-HU, anti-YO, anti-RI, anti-amphiphysin, anti-CV2, anti-MA2, anti-MGT30, AGNA, and anti-recoverin. The results were negative.
Patient: What about the lumbar puncture?
Doctor: The lumbar puncture was performed 1 year after your symptoms started, and the spinal fluid analysis showed 4 cells and protein. We will continue to monitor your condition and explore other possible causes of your symptoms. Please continue to follow up with us and let us know if there are any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns.","S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, reports progressive cerebellar ataxia starting a week after a respiratory viral infection, characterized by severe dysarthria, unsteady gait, and inability to walk or stand unattended. Symptoms worsened over two weeks and then stabilized. Additional symptoms include daily nausea, vomiting for six months, significant weight loss (66 pounds), and tingling in hands and feet. No recent bowel or bladder dysfunction or mood changes reported.
O: Neurological examination revealed severe dysarthria, bilateral horizontal nystagmus, pronounced ataxia, bilateral dysdiadochokinesia, generalized hypotonia, and absent deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. Sensory examination showed distal pinprick hypoesthesia, reduced proprioception, and vibration sense in lower limbs. Electromyography indicated severe axonal sensitive polyneuropathy with mild motor involvement. Blood tests were unremarkable. Serological screening for autoimmune and paraneoplastic conditions was negative. Lumbar puncture showed 4 cells and protein in spinal fluid.
A: The primary diagnosis is parainfectious cerebellar ataxia, likely secondary to a viral infection, with differential diagnoses including autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndromes, both currently unsupported by serological and clinical findings. The presence of severe axonal polyneuropathy suggests a complex, possibly multi-factorial neurological disorder.
P: Continue high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone treatment and monitor for any clinical improvement.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you have a past medical history of HIV with a CD4 count of 32/mm3, and you've presented to the emergency department today with a chief complaint of left-sided weakness and altered mental status. Can you tell me more about these symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, doc. I've been feeling really weak on my left side, and I've been having trouble thinking clearly.
Doctor: I see. Have you been falling asleep intermittently or been a poor historian during any conversations recently?
Patient: Yeah, I've been dozing off quite a bit and having trouble remembering things.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing. I also learned from your family that you were diagnosed with HIV more than 5 years ago and have been noncompliant with treatments. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I haven't been taking my medications regularly.
Doctor: During the physical examination, we noted that your vital signs are mostly stable, but you have an elevated blood pressure of 150/92 mm Hg. Also, there's an 8-cm fixed, subcutaneous mass on your left frontoparietal skull. The rest of the dermatologic examination revealed intact skin without erythema or ulceration. 
Patient: Oh, I didn't realize I had a mass on my skull.
Doctor: Yes, it's something we need to investigate further. We also did some laboratory tests and found mild leukocytosis (10.7 × 109/L) and neutrophilia (6.4 × 109/L). We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head without contrast, which showed no intracranial hemorrhage. However, we found multiple masses, including a 2.8-cm right superior frontal intra-axial hyperdense mass with an adjacent mixed density 2.7-cm right frontal mass, a 1.6-cm right frontal nodule, a 7-mm right frontal hypodense nodule, and a 1.3-cm left frontal nodule. These lesions were associated with marked surrounding infiltrative versus vasogenic edema, which are suspicious for malignancy.
Patient: That sounds serious, doc.
Doctor: Yes, it is concerning. In addition, we found a left frontal infiltrative osseous mass with overlying soft tissue swelling, which is compatible with malignancy. We did subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain and found a 2.5-cm destructive bone lesion in your left frontal skull with a large soft tissue mass in the left frontal scalp and multiple enhancing masses in both cerebral hemispheres measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter with surrounding edema. These findings are consistent with metastatic disease to the brain and skull.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that there is a possibility of cancer that has spread to your brain and skull. We also performed a chest X-ray, which showed a 4.3-cm left hilar mass, and a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis, revealing a 6.2 × 3.8 cm lobulated mass. These findings further indicate the possibility of cancer.
Patient: What should I do now, doc?
Doctor: We need to perform further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment for you. We will also discuss your case with a team of specialists to ensure the best possible care. It's important to follow up with your medical appointments and consider being more compliant with your HIV treatments.
Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I'll follow your advice and try to be more compliant with my treatments.","S: The patient, with a history of HIV and a CD4 count of 32/mm3, presents with left-sided weakness and altered mental status, including intermittent dozing and memory issues. The patient admits to noncompliance with HIV treatments.
O: Vital signs show elevated blood pressure at 150/92 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals an 8-cm fixed subcutaneous mass on the left frontoparietal skull. Laboratory tests indicate mild leukocytosis (10.7 × 109/L) and neutrophilia (6.4 × 109/L). CT and MRI scans of the head reveal multiple brain masses and a destructive bone lesion in the left frontal skull, suggestive of metastatic disease. Chest X-ray and CT scans show a 4.3-cm left hilar mass and a 6.2 × 3.8 cm lobulated mass in the chest, respectively.
A: Primary assessment suggests metastatic cancer involving the brain, skull, and possibly the chest, in the context of advanced HIV infection and immunosuppression. Differential diagnoses could include primary brain tumors and opportunistic infections due to low CD4 count.
P: Plan to perform additional diagnostic tests to confirm the nature of the masses and extent of spread. Referral to oncology for evaluation of potential cancer treatment and to infectious disease for management of HIV. Emphasize the importance of medication compliance and schedule regular follow-up appointments.

I also learned from your family that you were diagnosed with HIV more than 5 years ago and have been noncompliant with treatments. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I haven't been taking my medications regularly.\nDoctor: During the physical examination, we noted that your vital signs are mostly stable, but you have an elevated blood pressure of 150/92 mm Hg. Also, there's an 8-cm fixed, subcutaneous mass on your left frontoparietal skull. The rest of the dermatologic examination revealed intact skin without erythema or ulceration. \nPatient: Oh, I didn't realize I had a mass on my skull.\nDoctor: Yes, it's something we need to investigate further. We also did some laboratory tests and found mild leukocytosis (10.7 × 109/L) and neutrophilia (6.4 × 109/L). We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head without contrast, which showed no intracranial hemorrhage. However, we found multiple masses, including a 2.8-cm right superior frontal intra-axial hyperdense mass with an adjacent mixed density 2.7-cm right frontal mass, a 1.6-cm right frontal nodule, a 7-mm right frontal hypodense nodule, and a 1.3-cm left frontal nodule. These lesions were associated with marked surrounding infiltrative versus vasogenic edema, which are suspicious for malignancy.\nPatient: That sounds serious, doc.\nDoctor: Yes, it is concerning. In addition, we found a left frontal infiltrative osseous mass with overlying soft tissue swelling, which is compatible with malignancy. We did subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain and found a 2.5-cm destructive bone lesion in your left frontal skull with a large soft tissue mass in the left frontal scalp and multiple enhancing masses in both cerebral hemispheres measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter with surrounding edema. These findings are consistent with metastatic disease to the brain and skull.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means that there is a possibility of cancer that has spread to your brain and skull. We also performed a chest X-ray, which showed a 4.3-cm left hilar mass, and a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis, revealing a 6.2 × 3.8 cm lobulated mass.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you have a history of acute inflammatory demyelinating process and have recently been experiencing a mass in your left hand. Can you tell me more about when you first noticed it?
Patient: Yeah, about 3 months ago, I started feeling this mass on my left wrist and the hypothenar area of my hand. It's been getting more and more uncomfortable.
Doctor: I see. You were admitted to the hospital with generalized weakness, ataxia, and multiple sensory deficits, including a complete lack of sensation in your left small finger and the ulnar side of your hand. Can you tell me more about these symptoms?
Patient: Sure, I've been feeling really weak and unsteady, and I've lost all feeling in my left pinky and the side of my hand. It's been really difficult to do things with my left hand.
Doctor: We initially thought that the sensory deficits were related to your demyelinating disorder, but upon examination, we believe that the ulnar deficit is related to the mass in your hand. The mass is soft, nontender, and doesn't limit your range of motion. Your grip strength seems decreased compared to your other hand, though we haven't measured it objectively yet. Have you experienced any trauma, previous surgeries, or other masses in the past?
Patient: No, I haven't had any trauma or surgeries, and I've never had any other masses before.
Doctor: We've also done radiographs of your left upper extremity, which appeared normal. Our initial diagnosis is that the mass could be a lipoma. We conducted a magnetic resonance angiography of your left hand to get a better understanding of the mass, but its etiology is still unclear (Fig. ).
Patient: Hmm, so what's the next step, then?
Doctor: We performed an operative excision under general anesthesia to remove the mass. We made a longitudinally oriented ulnar-sided skin incision, dissected the palmar fascia, and released Guyon's canal. The mass was found to be arising from beneath the hypothenar musculature, and it appeared tan-white, rubbery, and lobulated (Fig. ).
Patient: What did the pathology report say?
Doctor: The pathology report confirmed that the mass is a benign myxoma (Fig. ). There were no postoperative complications, which is a good sign.
Patient: That's a relief. How am I recovering from the surgery?
Doctor: At 5 weeks postoperatively, you reported marked improvement in your numbness and weakness. We found that you have intact sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution distal to the site of the excised mass, and your grip strength has improved.
Patient: That's great to hear! What do I need to do now?
Doctor: We would like you to return in several months for a repeat sensorimotor assessment. However, I understand that you were subsequently lost to follow-up. It's important that we continue to monitor your progress and ensure that there are no further issues.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you're an 8-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with congenital heart disease during infancy, but had unknown follow-up and treatment. What brings you here today?
Patient: I've been feeling really tired and having trouble breathing when I'm playing with my friends. It started about a month ago.
Doctor: I see. When you were admitted to the hospital, we did a physical examination and found a systolic murmur in your left para-sternum. An echocardiography was also performed, revealing a peri-membranous VSD with a diameter of 12 mm, left to right shunting, and a pressure gradient of 20 mmHg. Additionally, we found a PDA with a diameter of 4 mm. 
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What did you do to treat it?
Doctor: First, we performed a trans-catheter PDA closure. Then, 3 weeks later, we did a TES for VSD repair without robotic assistance. During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position with your arms along your body, under general anesthesia with a single-lumen endotracheal tube.
Patient: What else did you do during the surgery?
Doctor: We used a no.6 Knitted Dacron graft to connect your right common FA with an end-to-side anastomosis. The other side of the graft was connected to the arterial line of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. We also inserted SVC and IVC cannulae via your internal jugular vein (IJV) and femoral vein, respectively, using the Seldinger technique.
Patient: And then what happened?
Doctor: When we started the CPB, your arterial pressure gradually increased to 260 mmHg. So, we switched to bilateral FA cannulation by inserting an additional 10Fr FA cannula directly into your left common FA. After that, your arterial pressure declined and stabilized at 180-200 mmHg.
Patient: How did you perform the surgery?
Doctor: We placed four soft trocars in the right side of your chest to assist with the procedure.
Patient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. It's important that you understand your condition and the treatment you received. Please make sure to attend your follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress and ensure a successful recovery.","S: The patient, an 8-year-old female with a history of congenital heart disease diagnosed in infancy, presents with symptoms of fatigue and difficulty breathing during play, which started about a month ago.

When you were admitted to the hospital, we did a physical examination and found a systolic murmur in your left para-sternum. An echocardiography was also performed, revealing a peri-membranous VSD with a diameter of 12 mm, left to right shunting, and a pressure gradient of 20 mmHg. Additionally, we found a PDA with a diameter of 4 mm. \nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What did you do to treat it?\nDoctor: First, we performed a trans-catheter PDA closure. Then, 3 weeks later, we did a TES for VSD repair without robotic assistance. During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position with your arms along your body, under general anesthesia with a single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nPatient: What else did you do during the surgery?\nDoctor: We used a no.6 Knitted Dacron graft to connect your right common FA with an end-to-side anastomosis. The other side of the graft was connected to the arterial line of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. We also inserted SVC and IVC cannulae via your internal jugular vein (IJV) and femoral vein, respectively, using the Seldinger technique.\nPatient: And then what happened?\nDoctor: When we started the CPB, your arterial pressure gradually increased to 260 mmHg. So, we switched to bilateral FA cannulation by inserting an additional 10Fr FA cannula directly into your left common FA. After that, your arterial pressure declined and stabilized at 180-200 mmHg.\nPatient: How did you perform the surgery?\nDoctor: We placed four soft trocars in the right side of your chest to assist with the procedure.\nPatient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. It's important that you understand your condition and the treatment you received. Please make sure to attend your follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress and ensure a successful recovery.""}

"Doctor: Hi, I understand that you're a 64-year-old woman with cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis C. You were recently transplanted to treat drug-induced fulminant hepatitis failure. Can you tell me about your symptoms and how you're feeling?
Patient: Yes, after the transplant, I was given a standard post-op immunosuppressive protocol with corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. I also received caspofungin for targeted prophylaxis against IA.
Doctor: It seems that you had a difficult early post-operative period with hemorrhagic episodes and peri-hepatic hematoma, which required several re-interventions. Were you able to maintain the antifungal prophylactic treatment during this time?
Patient: Yes, I continued the treatment even during those interventions.
Doctor: Unfortunately, from post-operative day 31, you developed several septic shocks caused by Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Candida glabrata. Were you treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics at that time?
Patient: Yes, they gave me antibiotics and also reintroduced caspofungin.
Doctor: I see that on post-operative day 63, you had a fever resistant to antibiotics. Did you have any other symptoms or discomfort?
Patient: Well, I was feeling very weak, and my chest was hurting a bit.
Doctor: Your chest CT-scan showed right-sided pleural effusion with passive atelectasis and alveolar opacity. They performed a broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) on you, and the direct examination displayed Aspergillus-like branched hyphae. Were you aware of these findings?
Patient: Yes, the doctor mentioned something about that.
Doctor: At the same time, your galactomannan (GM) antigen index and (1–3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) in serum, which were previously negative, became positive. Your GM antigen index was > 6 (threshold index: 0.5), and your BDG was 234 pg/mL (threshold value: 80 pg/mL). Did they inform you about these results?
Patient: Yes, they said that my antigen levels were higher than normal.
Doctor: They also found that the Aspergillus real-time PCR was positive in your serum with a Cq value of 35. Based on the data from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group, you were classified as having probable invasive aspergillosis. This may be contributing to your fever and chest pain. We will need to adjust your treatment to address this infection.
Patient: Oh, I see. What should I do now?
Doctor: We will work closely with your transplant team to manage the infection and monitor your progress. It's important to follow the treatment plan and keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms. We'll do our best to help you recover and maintain your health.

Doctor: I see. We've noticed that you have areflexic acute flaccid paralysis present on all four extremities. We've conducted some laboratory tests to better understand your condition. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate is slightly elevated at 21 mm/h, compared to the average of 15 mm/h.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Your blood count, acetylcholine receptor antibody, thyroid function tests, and other laboratory findings are all within the normal range. However, there are no cells present in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the CSF protein is high at 65 mg/dL.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean, doc?
Doctor: These findings could suggest some sort of neurological issue. On the second day of your hospitalization, you developed bilateral peripheral facial paralysis. Additionally, nerve conduction studies showed a decrease in the sensory and motor action potentials of your upper extremities, with increased distal latencies.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: It is quite concerning. We also couldn't obtain any combined muscle action potential (CMAP) from your bilateral peroneal-tibial nerves or sural nerve sensory action potential. To help you, we decided to perform plasma exchange every other day, for a total of three times due to your respiratory distress.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Unfortunately, you developed resistant hypotension as an autonomic dysfunction, along with pulmonary infections. We tried our best to control the hypotension, but it persisted.
Patient: Oh no...

Doctor: I see, let's run some routine blood tests to check your renal function and perform an ultrasound scan of your urinary tract to see if there might be any issues.
Patient: Okay, that sounds good.
[After tests and scan]
Doctor: Your blood tests show a derangement in your renal function and the ultrasound scan revealed right-sided hydronephrosis. We need to do a further computed tomography (CT) scan of your kidneys, ureters, and bladder to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
Patient: Alright, let's do it.
[After CT scan]
Doctor: The CT scan showed a dilatation of the ureter up to the vesicoureteric junction with an associated tight stricture. We'll need to perform a right rigid ureteroscopy, ureteric biopsy, and ureteric stent insertion to get a better understanding of the issue.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
[After procedure]
Doctor: The histology report from the biopsy shows that you have transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter. Initially, we didn't perform any neuroendocrine markers because the tumor didn't show any classical signs of a carcinoid tumor or a well-differentiated small cell carcinoma. However, further examination revealed an atypical carcinoid pattern.
Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We did some further imaging of your chest and fortunately, we didn't find any distant metastases. Our plan is to perform a right laparoscopic nephroureterectomy and open excision of the bladder cuff to remove the tumor.
Patient: I'm glad there's a plan in place. Let's do what needs to be done.
[After surgery]
Doctor: The surgery went well. The tumor in your ureter was about 18 mm long, and we were able to achieve a clear resection margin of at least 4 mm. Microscopy of the ureteric specimen showed a positive immunohistochemical stain with CD56, a common neuroendocrine marker. Staining with other neuroendocrine markers was weakly positive. The tumor was intermediate to high grade, with a high Ki-67 proliferation index of 25 to 30%. We didn't find any associated carcinoma in situ or definite lymphovascular invasion.
Patient: That's a relief. What does that mean for my recovery?
Doctor: The tumor infiltrated through the muscle into the periureteric fat, which is a T3 stage. Your kidney showed patchy lymphocytic infiltrates, indicating mild interstitial nephritis, but there was no tumor infiltration into the kidney or the urothelium covering the renal pelvis.
Patient: So, what are the next steps?
Doctor: You made an unremarkable recovery from the surgery. As you remain well and your chromogranin levels are only mildly elevated and stable, the oncologist decided that there's no need for adjuvant therapy at this time. We'll continue to monitor your condition closely.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your help.","S: The patient presented with right-sided loin pain and microscopic hematuria, without any urinary symptoms. The patient's history includes undergoing diagnostic tests and a surgical procedure for the identified condition.
O: Initial blood tests indicated renal function derangement. Ultrasound showed right-sided hydronephrosis. CT scan revealed a dilatation of the ureter up to the vesicoureteric junction with a tight stricture. Histology from a ureteric biopsy diagnosed transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter, with immunohistochemical staining positive for CD56 and weakly positive for other neuroendocrine markers. The tumor was intermediate to high grade with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 25 to 30%. Surgery achieved a clear resection margin of 4 mm, and the tumor was staged as T3. Post-operative recovery was unremarkable.
A: The primary diagnosis is transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter, stage T3. The differential diagnosis initially considered included other forms of urothelial carcinoma or a neuroendocrine tumor, which was ruled out based on further testing. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the successful surgical resection and absence of distant metastases or lymphovascular invasion.
P: The patient underwent right laparoscopic nephroureterectomy and open excision of the bladder cuff. Post-surgery, the plan includes close monitoring without adjuvant therapy as the chromogranin levels are only mildly elevated and stable. Regular follow-ups with oncology are scheduled to monitor for any recurrence or progression of the disease.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm glad you're here today for a follow-up regarding your long-standing daytime sleepiness. Can you describe your sleepiness episodes and how they affect your daily life?
Patient: Yeah, I often experience sudden onsets of sleep, even while standing up, and sometimes I lose up to 30 minutes. It's been really frustrating.
Doctor: I see. Do you ever have cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, or sleep paralysis during these episodes?
Patient: No, I don't have any of those.
Doctor: Okay. I have your initial evaluation report from 1993, which indicated that you had 32 awakenings, 2 apnea/hypopnea spells, and a mean sleep onset of 5.9 minutes during the sleep studies. You were also observed to enter REM sleep in at least two and possibly four of the five naps. Did anything change since then?
Patient: I moved and went to your sleep disorders center in 2004 with the same complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness. I wasn't on any specific treatment at that time.
Doctor: Thanks for the information. Did you experience any sleepwalking episodes during this time?
Patient: Yes, I had some episodes where I was walking on the roof of a chemical plant where I worked or even smoking a cigarette on my front porch.
Doctor: I see that an overnight polysomnogram (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were performed in 2004. There was no significant sleep-disordered breathing, abnormal increase in muscle tone, or unusual activity during REM or non-REM sleep. Sleep occurred on all four nap opportunities, with a mean sleep latency of 10 minutes and no sleep onset REM periods. Were you given any treatments after these tests?
Patient: Yes, I was given stimulant medications and advised to extend my nocturnal sleep period. Methylphenidate at 20 mg per day didn't help much, and higher doses up to 60 mg per day made me irritable and angry. I also tried modafinil, but I couldn't tolerate it because of gastrointestinal effects.
Doctor: I understand. I have the results of the repeat PSG and MSLT performed in 2008. The PSG showed excellent sleep efficiency at 96.5%, normal REM latency of 93.5 minutes, REM sleep comprising 16.8% of total sleep time, and normal slow wave sleep. MSLT results are also within normal limits. Based on this information, we'll work on finding a new treatment plan for your daytime sleepiness. We'll continue to monitor your progress and make adjustments as needed.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and hope we can find a solution to my daytime sleepiness soon.","S: The patient reports long-standing excessive daytime sleepiness, with sudden sleep episodes lasting up to 30 minutes, even while standing.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that your male infant was referred to our intensive care unit from a peripheral facility. Can you please describe the symptoms he has been experiencing?
Parent: Yes, he has had one day of progressively worsening difficulty in breathing and feeding. He also had multiple convulsions of generalized tonic clonic nature.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Upon examination, we found that he was dyspneic, afebrile, and tachycardic, with cold extremities, weak pulses, and a delayed capillary refill of 4 seconds. His blood pressure was 98/64 mmHg, and his blood sugar was 14.4 mmol l–1. We also performed an arterial blood gas test, which showed a mixed metabolic/respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.1, hypercapnia (pCO2 55 mmHg), and decreased bicarbonate levels (20 mEq l–1). His white cell count was 15.6 × 109 µl–1, largely consisting of neutrophils (76%), and he had a reactive thrombocytosis (605 × 109 µl–1) and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.24. His chest radiograph appeared normal. Can you tell me more about his medical history?
Parent: Well, he had an uneventful natal and postnatal period, but he has been suffering from nasal congestion for the past 3 weeks. We've been treating it with nasal saline drops, antihistamines, antibiotics, and antipyretics.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. In the ICU, we immediately intubated him with an endotracheal tube that is 3.5 mm in diameter and 11 cm in length. We also started him on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and clarithromycin, for severe pneumonia and sepsis. Additionally, he was given phenytoin and morphine.
Doctor: We also noticed a firm, smooth, immobile left submandibular mass, extending to the neck levels II-V. We performed a CT scan, which revealed a 27 mm × 47 mm × 42 mm parapharyngeal/paravertebral cystic mass that is obliterating the oropharyngeal airway. Acute left LST was also discovered and confirmed via an MRI.
Parent: Oh, that sounds serious. What are the next steps in his treatment?
Doctor: We have started him on low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) at a dosage of 1 mg/kg–1. Additionally, we performed an ultrasound-guided aspiration, which revealed pus. We drained 20 ml of fluid and flushed the cavity with 40 mg of gentamicin.
Doctor: We will continue to closely monitor your son's condition and adjust his treatment as needed. Our team will do everything we can to ensure that he receives the best possible care while he is in the ICU.

"Doctor: Hi, I understand that you've presented to our hand and peripheral nerve clinic 4 months after an attempted Nexplanon® removal from your left arm. Can you tell me more about that experience?
Patient: Yeah, my nurse practitioner tried to remove it, but neither of us was able to feel the Nexplanon® before the removal. They didn't do any imaging studies to confirm its location.
Doctor: I see. So, what happened during the removal attempt?
Patient: They injected some local anesthetic and made a small incision at the site of insertion. But they couldn't find the Nexplanon® right away. After exploring the area, the NP grabbed something in my arm, and I felt an ""electric shock"" sensation that went down to my medial elbow as they pulled on it.
Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened after the removal attempt?
Patient: I had complete numbness in my small and ring fingers. I went back to my NP for a follow-up, but the numbness didn't improve over time. I also started to notice my hand muscles wasting away and my grip getting weaker.
Doctor: That's concerning. Did your NP order any tests to investigate this issue?
Patient: Yes, they ordered a nerve conduction study almost 4 months after the attempted removal. The results showed a 50% loss of ulnar nerve function.
Doctor: Based on your presentation, it appears that you have a severe, chronic ulnar nerve injury. On examination, I can see the classic signs: wasting of the ulnar nerve-innervated intrinsic muscles of your hand, a claw position of your ring and small fingers, and dense numbness in an ulnar sensory nerve distribution. I also noticed a well-healed incision with surrounding scar tissue from the extraction attempt. Can you feel the Nexplanon® in your arm now?
Patient: No, I still can't feel it.
Doctor: We took some X-rays, and they showed the radio-opaque Nexplanon® at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of your humeral shaft, with the most distal end 16.5 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle.
Patient: Oh, I see. What does this mean for me, and what are the next steps?
Doctor: Given your history and the current state of your ulnar nerve injury, we need to discuss your options for treatment and recovery. We will also need to plan the proper removal of the Nexplanon® to avoid any further complications. I'll consult with my colleagues and come up with the best course of action for your situation.

Patient: Hi, Dr. Smith. I'm a bit nervous but ready to get this done.
Doctor: I understand. During the rewarming process following your PTE, we noticed bright red blood in your airway. We performed a bronchoscopy and found that there was bleeding from your right lung.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds scary.
Doctor: It was concerning, but we attempted to control the bleeding by placing a right-sided Arndt endobronchial blocker. Unfortunately, due to copious bleeding, our first attempt was unsuccessful.
Patient: What happened next?
Doctor: We exchanged your 8.0 mm single lumen ETT for a 9 mm single lumen ETT. Then, we were able to successfully place a right-sided 9Fr Arndt endobronchial blocker with the aid of a 6.0 mm outer diameter therapeutic bronchoscope. This helped contain the bleeding.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: We continued weaning you off the cardiopulmonary bypass, and everything went well. You were then transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.
Patient: So, what's next for me?
Doctor: Unfortunately, your postoperative course has been complicated by renal failure, reintubation for hemoptysis, and poor neurologic recovery. Due to these multiple complications, we have been discussing the best course of action with your family.

"Doctor: Hi there! I see you recently presented 2 weeks after an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis. How have you been feeling since the surgery?
Patient: Well, I've been having some issues with my urinary frequency. It's reduced to just twice per day and I'm experiencing prolonged hesitancy.
Doctor: I see. Can you describe your micturition stream for me?
Patient: Initially, it was weak and slow, but now it has become interrupted. Straining doesn't seem to help make the stream stronger.
Doctor: Alright. Have you ever suffered from urinary tract infections (UTIs) or constipation before?
Patient: No, I've never had any UTIs or constipation. I usually open my bowels daily.
Doctor: I understand you also had an episode of acute cystitis 2 months later. How was that treated?
Patient: I completely lost my ability to void, so I was put on an indwelling Foley urinary catheter. My cystitis was successfully treated with antibiotics.
Doctor: And what happened after the catheter was removed?
Patient: After every attempt to remove it, I had to be catheterized again, and they registered between 300 to 1200 mL of urine volume.
Doctor: How did that make you feel?
Patient: I lost the urge to urinate and only felt a dull pain in the suprapubic region and right iliac fossa when my bladder was extremely distended.
Doctor: I see you were referred to a tertiary center to determine the cause of your urinary retention. What were the results of your examinations?
Patient: They examined me and found normal clinical findings. They also did an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound scan but didn't find any obvious pathology. A pediatric neurologist checked me out and found nothing abnormal.
Doctor: Did they perform any additional tests, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG), somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) of the tibial nerve, electroencephalogram (EEG), or a lumbar puncture?
Patient: Yes, they did all of those tests, but they still didn't find any pathology.
Doctor: What about any gynecological examinations?
Patient: The gynecologist found multiple follicular cysts on my ovaries bilaterally but nothing that would explain my urinary retention.
Doctor: Our pediatric urologist performed an examination under general anesthesia. Have you been informed about the results?
Patient: They mentioned something about a free calibration of the urethra up to 26F and normal findings on cystoscopy.
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. The videourodynamic study (VUDS) showed an asensitive and hypotonic bladder. They had to stop the bladder filling at 360 mL due to your discomfort. The maximum intravesical pressure achieved was 11 cmH2O. Did you experience any discomfort when they pulled the urodynamic catheter out?
Patient: Yes, I felt some discomfort during that part of the procedure.
Doctor: Thank you for all the information. We will continue to monitor your condition and work on finding the cause of your urinary retention. In the meantime, please keep us updated on any changes in your symptoms.","S: The patient, who underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis two weeks ago, reports decreased urinary frequency (twice per day) with prolonged hesitancy, weak and interrupted micturition stream, and no improvement with straining. The patient denies previous history of urinary tract infections or constipation and reports daily bowel movements. Post-appendectomy, the patient experienced acute cystitis treated with antibiotics and required repeated catheterization due to inability to void, with urine volumes ranging from 300 to 1200 mL. The patient also reports loss of the urge to urinate and dull pain in the suprapubic region and right iliac fossa when the bladder is extremely distended.
O: Physical and ultrasound examinations at a tertiary center showed no obvious pathology. Neurological evaluations including MRI, EMG, SEP, EEG, and lumbar puncture revealed no abnormalities. Gynecological examination identified bilateral ovarian follicular cysts but no findings related to urinary retention. Pediatric urology assessment under general anesthesia showed free urethral calibration up to 26F and normal cystoscopy findings. Videourodynamic study indicated an asensitive and hypotonic bladder with maximum intravesical pressure of 11 cmH2O, and bladder filling was stopped at 360 mL due to discomfort.
A: The primary diagnosis is urinary retention with an asensitive and hypotonic bladder, post-surgical. Differential diagnoses could include neurogenic bladder, though current evaluations have not supported this. The presence of ovarian follicular cysts appears incidental and unrelated to the urinary symptoms.
P: Continue monitoring the patient's urinary function and symptoms. Plan for regular follow-up visits to reassess bladder function and response to any interventions. Consider consultation with a neurologist specializing in autonomic dysfunction given the lack of findings from standard neurological tests and the nature of bladder dysfunction. Educate the patient on recognizing signs of urinary tract infections and bladder distension. Discuss potential need for intermittent catheterization if spontaneous voiding does not improve. Encourage the patient to maintain adequate hydration and report any new symptoms or changes in urinary habits.",Create a medical SOAP summary of this dialogue.,"[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert medical professor assisting in the creation of medically accurate SOAP summaries.

I see you recently presented 2 weeks after an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis. How have you been feeling since the surgery?\nPatient: Well, I've been having some issues with my urinary frequency. It's reduced to just twice per day and I'm experiencing prolonged hesitancy.\nDoctor: I see. Can you describe your micturition stream for me?\nPatient: Initially, it was weak and slow, but now it has become interrupted. Straining doesn't seem to help make the stream stronger.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you ever suffered from urinary tract infections (UTIs) or constipation before?\nPatient: No, I've never had any UTIs or constipation. I usually open my bowels daily.\nDoctor: I understand you also had an episode of acute cystitis 2 months later. How was that treated?\nPatient: I completely lost my ability to void, so I was put on an indwelling Foley urinary catheter. My cystitis was successfully treated with antibiotics.\nDoctor: And what happened after the catheter was removed?\nPatient: After every attempt to remove it, I had to be catheterized again, and they registered between 300 to 1200 mL of urine volume.\nDoctor: How did that make you feel?\nPatient: I lost the urge to urinate and only felt a dull pain in the suprapubic region and right iliac fossa when my bladder was extremely distended.\nDoctor: I see you were referred to a tertiary center to determine the cause of your urinary retention. What were the results of your examinations?\nPatient: They examined me and found normal clinical findings. They also did an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound scan but didn't find any obvious pathology. A pediatric neurologist checked me out and found nothing abnormal.\nDoctor: Did they perform any additional tests, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG), somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) of the tibial nerve, electroencephalogram (EEG), or a lumbar puncture?\nPatient: Yes, they did all of those tests, but they still didn't find any pathology.\nDoctor: What about any gynecological examinations?\nPatient: The gynecologist found multiple follicular cysts on my ovaries bilaterally but nothing that would explain my urinary retention.\nDoctor: Our pediatric urologist performed an examination under general anesthesia. Have you been informed about the results?\nPatient: They mentioned something about a free calibration of the urethra up to 26F and normal findings on cystoscopy.\nDoctor: Yes, that's correct. The videourodynamic study (VUDS) showed an asensitive and hypotonic bladder. They had to stop the bladder filling at 360 mL due to your discomfort. The maximum intravesical pressure achieved was 11 cmH2O. Did you experience any discomfort when they pulled the urodynamic catheter out?\nPatient: Yes, I felt some discomfort during that part of the procedure.\nDoctor: Thank you for all the information.

"Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I'm a 45-year-old English teacher, and I've been suffering from right knee pain for about a year now. It got worse eight months ago.
Doctor: I see. Can you recall any trauma or injury that might have led to this pain?
Patient: No, I don't remember any specific trauma.
Doctor: What kind of treatment have you received so far?
Patient: I underwent conservative treatment at another clinic for six months. They prescribed intermittent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, some injections, but I don't know the exact drug, and physical therapy.
Doctor: Okay, how would you describe your pain and any other symptoms?
Patient: I have severe anterior knee pain when climbing stairs or squatting. Also, I've noticed a cystic mass in the posterior aspect of my knee joint that's been increasing in size.
Doctor: Let's perform a physical examination. *After examining* I found mild swelling and effusion in your right knee, but no localized heat sense. Painful crepitation and moderate tenderness are present during knee motion. There's also a large, non-tender cystic mass in the posterior aspect of the right knee joint. I noticed crepitation in your left knee too, but you mentioned no discomfort on the left side, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. No pain on the left side at all.
Doctor: I also observed that there's no cystic lesion on your left knee. Your right infrapatellar region is larger than normal and feels firm. Your passive full knee range of motion is possible, but painful. There's no tenderness on your tibial tubercle or patella.
Patient: Hmm, what do you think is causing this?
Doctor: I've reviewed your plain radiographic examination, and it shows a large ossicle beneath the patellar tendon and inside the infrapatellar fat pad in your right knee. Interestingly, there's a similar-sized ossicle in your left knee, partially fused to the hypertrophied tibial tuberosity.
Patient: What about the MRI results?
Doctor: Your right knee magnetic resonance images show a 3.8 x 1.3 x 3.0 cm sized, well-circumscribed ossicle. There are several smaller ossicles near the tibial tubercle as well. Inflammatory changes in synovium, infrapatellar fat pad, and patellar tendon are also visible. A reactive bone marrow edema was found at the anterior aspect of the tibial condyle.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we'll discuss a treatment plan that may include medication, additional therapy, or even surgery if necessary. We will closely monitor your progress and make adjustments as needed. It's important to follow up regularly and report any changes in your symptoms.
Patient: Alright, thank you for your help, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll work together to get you back on your feet as soon as possible.","S: The patient is a 45-year-old English teacher who reports suffering from right knee pain for approximately one year, worsening eight months ago. The pain is described as severe, particularly when climbing stairs or squatting. The patient also notes a growing cystic mass in the posterior aspect of the right knee. No specific trauma is recalled. Previous treatments include intermittent NSAIDs, unspecified injections, and physical therapy.
O: Physical examination reveals mild swelling and effusion in the right knee, with no localized heat. There is painful crepitation and moderate tenderness during knee motion, and a large, non-tender cystic mass in the posterior aspect of the right knee. The patient's right infrapatellar region is enlarged and firm. Full passive knee range of motion is possible but painful.

Doctor: I see. In that case, let me check your vital signs. We need to find out what's causing this shock. Have you had any recent medical issues?
Patient: Yes, I was hospitalized a month ago in your department and underwent a patch repair for a gastric ulcer perforation.
Doctor: Alright, let's perform a contrast-enhanced CT scan to get more information. 
(After CT scan)
Doctor: The CT scan revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in your pancreatic head, aneurysm formation in the PDA, and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk. Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA, but no liquid was retained in your peritoneal cavity.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What should we do?
Doctor: We will perform an emergent IVR for hemostasis to address the retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured PDA aneurysm. Arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) will be done through a sheath introduced in your right femoral artery.
Patient: Okay, go ahead.
(After the procedure)
Doctor: The imaging of the SMA revealed the development of several collaterals in your pancreatic head, and the common and proper hepatic arteries were imaged via these collaterals. The aneurysm in your PDA had leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent with a diameter of 9.3 mm. We have completed the IVR hemostasis by performing PDA coil embolization.
Patient: So, what's next?
Doctor: We will conduct SMA arteriography to see the other collaterals perfusing your proper hepatic artery. After the IVR therapy, we will monitor your blood chemical analysis for several weeks to ensure that your transaminase level is not elevated and hepatic infarction is negative.
Patient: Got it. And what about the obstruction caused by the hematoma?
Doctor: We observed obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma for a few weeks. However, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.
Patient: That's a relief. What could have caused all this?
Doctor: In your case, collateral perfusion pathways from the SMA developed to compensate for the reduced CA blood flow due to MAL compression, and the aneurysm might have been generated in the PDA due to the abnormal changes in hemodynamic flow. Preservative treatment did not appear to relieve the CA compression. Additionally, we considered that new aneurysms may form following new collateral circulation after IVR hemostasis.
Patient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up on my treatments and tests.
Doctor: You're welcome. Please make sure to attend your follow-up appointments, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm experiencing sudden epigastric pain, and I feel like I'm in shock.\nDoctor: I see. In that case, let me check your vital signs. We need to find out what's causing this shock. Have you had any recent medical issues?\nPatient: Yes, I was hospitalized a month ago in your department and underwent a patch repair for a gastric ulcer perforation.\nDoctor: Alright, let's perform a contrast-enhanced CT scan to get more information. \n(After CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in your pancreatic head, aneurysm formation in the PDA, and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk. Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA, but no liquid was retained in your peritoneal cavity.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What should we do?\nDoctor: We will perform an emergent IVR for hemostasis to address the retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured PDA aneurysm. Arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) will be done through a sheath introduced in your right femoral artery.\nPatient: Okay, go ahead.\n(After the procedure)\nDoctor: The imaging of the SMA revealed the development of several collaterals in your pancreatic head, and the common and proper hepatic arteries were imaged via these collaterals. The aneurysm in your PDA had leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent with a diameter of 9.3 mm. We have completed the IVR hemostasis by performing PDA coil embolization.\nPatient: So, what's next?\nDoctor: We will conduct SMA arteriography to see the other collaterals perfusing your proper hepatic artery. After the IVR therapy, we will monitor your blood chemical analysis for several weeks to ensure that your transaminase level is not elevated and hepatic infarction is negative.\nPatient: Got it. And what about the obstruction caused by the hematoma?\nDoctor: We observed obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma for a few weeks. However, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.\nPatient: That's a relief. What could have caused all this?\nDoctor: In your case, collateral perfusion pathways from the SMA developed to compensate for the reduced CA blood flow due to MAL compression, and the aneurysm might have been generated in the PDA due to the abnormal changes in hemodynamic flow. Preservative treatment did not appear to relieve the CA compression. Additionally, we considered that new aneurysms may form following new collateral circulation after IVR hemostasis.\nPatient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up on my treatments and tests.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Please make sure to attend your follow-up appointments, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care!""}

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you're a 13-year-old girl who has been experiencing abdominal pain and bloody stool. Can you tell me more about how long this has been happening and how it's been progressing?
Patient: Yeah, I started having abdominal pain about 3 months ago. At first, it wasn't too bad and would come and go, so I didn't see a doctor. But lately, the pain has gotten worse, and I've been having bloody stool more often.
Doctor: I see. We performed an imaging study and it showed that there's a mass, including a fecalith, occupying your pelvic and right lower abdominal cavity (Fig.). Based on this, we made a preoperative diagnosis of an acute appendicitis with an appendiceal mass (Fig.). We've already done drainage of the abscess and an appendectomy.
Patient: Oh, okay. So what did you find during the procedure?
Doctor: Although the body of your appendix looked intact, as well as your ileum and cecum, the histopathological examination revealed PAA in the tip of the resected appendix. Because of this, we have planned a radical operation for the residual tumor of PAA in your pelvic cavity.
Patient: What does that operation involve?
Doctor: It involves a whole mass resection and ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection. In the first operation, we speculate that we removed the body of your appendix but left most of the mass and the tip of the appendix. So in the second operation, we will remove the mass that was derived from the tip of your appendix.
Patient: Will you need to remove any other organs?
Doctor: Unfortunately, yes. The masses are tightly adherent with infiltration into your sigmoid colon, uterus, and right ovary. We will need to remove these organs, and then perform a subsequent sigmoid colostomy (Fig.). However, we will preserve your left ovary to maintain your fertility.
Patient: What were the results of the pathological examination?
Doctor: The pathological findings demonstrated negative margins and no lymph node invasions. Your final pathological stage is pT4(SI)N0M0, stage II based on TNM-7th edition 2009.
Patient: How was my recovery after the operation?
Doctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, which is a good sign.
Patient: Did I receive any additional treatment after the operation?
Doctor: Yes, you received chemotherapy consisting of 6 cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6), followed by 6 cycles of simplified LV and 5-FU (sLV5FU2).
Patient: How am I doing now?
Doctor: You're doing well on follow-up, and there has been no progression of your condition. We'll continue to monitor your health closely to ensure your ongoing well-being.","S: A 13-year-old female patient reports a 3-month history of intermittent abdominal pain which has recently worsened, accompanied by frequent episodes of bloody stool.
O: Imaging studies revealed a mass with a fecalith in the pelvic and right lower abdominal cavity, leading to a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis with an appendiceal mass. Histopathological examination post-appendectomy identified pseudomyxoma appendicei (PAA) at the tip of the appendix. The patient underwent an appendectomy and drainage of an abscess.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having some problems for the past two years. I noticed a hard lesion in my anal canal, but I haven't gotten it officially diagnosed or treated yet.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other health issues during this time?
Patient: Yes, about ten months ago, I had a cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis.
Doctor: Did the doctors find anything during the perioperative diagnostic examination?
Patient: They did. They found some suspicious lesions in my anal canal and some enlarged pelvic lymph nodes.
Doctor: What about your medical history? Do you have any comorbidities or a family history of malignancies?
Patient: I have gout, and my Karnofsky performance status is 90. I've never had radiotherapy, but I do have a second-degree family history of malignancies.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Let's discuss the results of your digital rectal examination. It identified mild prostatomegaly and a palpable suspicious nodule in the left prostate lobe. There were no signs of extracapsular extension. Additionally, a large ulcerated mass was found in the dorsal anal canal wall, but no lymphadenopathies in the inguinal region.
Patient: Oh, I see. What about the colonoscopy?
Doctor: The colonoscopy confirmed the presence of a suspicious lesion on the posterior anal canal, extending up to the anorectal junction.
Patient: And the MRI results?
Doctor: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an infiltrative lesion of the anal canal with a maximum diameter of 3.2 cm, a high-grade suspicion of sphincter infiltration, and two enlarged lymphadenopathies in the mesorectum and right internal iliac region, both with a maximal diameter of 2 cm. These are suspicious of tumor metastases.
Patient: What about that area in the prostate?
Doctor: The MRI also found an area with a maximal diameter of 2 cm within the left prostate basis with restricted diffusion and a lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) than the surrounding healthy prostate tissue. It appeared hypointense on ADC maps but hyperintense on diffusion-weighted maps.
Patient: What did the biopsies show?
Doctor: The biopsies confirmed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal and a moderately differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (3 + 4) in both lobes.
Patient: Is there anything else I should know?
Doctor: You tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and your carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were also assessed.

O: Digital rectal examination revealed a hard lesion in the anal canal, enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, and a large ulcerated mass in the dorsal anal canal wall, but no signs of extracapsular extension. Colonoscopy confirmed a suspicious lesion on the posterior anal canal, extending up to the anorectal junction. MRI showed an infiltrative lesion of the anal canal with a maximum diameter of 3.2 cm, high-grade suspicion of sphincter infiltration, and two enlarged lymphadenopathies in the mesorectum and right internal iliac region, with a maximum diameter of 2 cm. MRI also found an area with a maximum diameter of 2 cm within the left prostate basis with restricted diffusion and a low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).
A: The primary diagnosis is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal and a moderately differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (3 +4) in both lobes. Differential diagnoses could include sphincter infiltration or tumor metastases.
P: The management plan will include close monitoring of the anal canal and the prostate. The patient will be advised to follow up with a colorectal oncologist for further evaluation and management of the anal canal and lymphadenopathies. "
"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have been monitored at a neurology clinic and were referred to our clinic due to sustained hemifacial pain on the right side. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. The pain has been bothering me for a while now.
Doctor: I also noticed that you have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2. Is it under control?
Patient: Yes, I've been managing it well.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I have reviewed your anterior rhinoscopic and endoscopic nasal examination results, and there were no pathological findings. However, your nasal septum is deviated to the left. Your hematological and biochemical parameters are normal, which is a good sign.
Patient: Oh, okay. So, what's causing the pain then?
Doctor: We performed a paranasal computed tomography (PNCT) imaging, and it revealed concha bullosa variation of the bilateral middle turbinates, and soft tissue density in the right concha bullosa. We then incised the concha bullosa by applying topical anesthesia to your right nasal cavity and performed a punch biopsy.
Patient: Hmm, and what did the pathology report say?
Doctor: The pathology report concluded that there were fungal hyphae and necrobiotic material. So, we prepared you for surgery. After receiving your written consent, we planned an endoscopic sinus surgery under general anesthesia.
Patient: I remember that. How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The surgery went well. We excised the lateral and inferior lamellae of the concha bullosa and submitted the infected material inside for pathologic examination. We controlled the bleeding, and the intervention was finalized.
Patient: That's a relief. What was my post-operative treatment?
Doctor: We prescribed a nasal wash and anti-inflammatory treatment for you. The pathological examination report revealed fungal organisms and their hyphae in the necrobiotic material. An advanced microbiological examination cultured ""Aspergillus oryzae"" through sequential analysis of the ribosomal DNA genes in the aspirated material.
Patient: So, how am I doing now?
Doctor: During your post-operative 6-month follow-up, we observed that your headache complaints were diminished and your nasal passage was open. It seems like the surgery and treatment have been successful.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Actually, I don't have any significant past medical history.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me what happened prior to your admission here?
Patient: I'm not sure. I just moved from Puerto Rico three weeks ago, and then I was found unresponsive at home with foamy secretions around my mouth.
Doctor: I see. You were found apneic and pulseless, so the paramedics performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on you. After prolonged CPR, you had the return of spontaneous circulation and were admitted to the ICU. We started you on therapeutic hypothermia as well.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Your urine toxicology showed the presence of cocaine, benzodiazepines, and cannabinoids. The most likely cause of your cardiac arrest was thought to be an overdose.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also initiated antibiotics, vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, along with vasopressors for septic shock. You were put on mechanical ventilation and intubation for respiratory failure. We have been closely monitoring your laboratory studies.
Patient: Okay, and what happened next?
Doctor: When we discontinued propofol, you remained unresponsive but showed muscle twitching. We performed an Electroencephalogram (EEG) which showed encephalopathy without seizure activity.
Patient: Hmm, that's concerning.
Doctor: On day three, you had repeated episodes of twitching, decerebrate posturing, and eyes rolling, so we restarted propofol. A repeat EEG showed similar results to the prior one. We also did a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain, which showed diffuse injury and restricted diffusion involving both basal ganglia, bilateral frontal, and occipital cortices.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is. You continued to have repeated episodes of decerebrate posturing, rhythmic jaw movements, sweating, fever, and tachycardia. Ultimately, we had to perform a tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: After a week of initial antibiotic treatment, your sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which resolved with a course of gentamicin nebulizers.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: We consulted infectious disease specialists for your repeated fevers. Your blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine Legionella antigen came back negative.
Patient: So, what could be causing the fevers?
Doctor: We did a urinalysis for infection, checked for decubitus ulcers and rashes, but nothing was identified. Thyroid function tests (TFT) ruled out hyperthyroidism, and an ultrasound of your abdomen showed no signs of acalculous cholecystitis. We also tested you for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and performed an interferon-gamma release assay, all of which came back negative.

Doctor: Hmm, I noticed that there are absent breath sounds on the right side of your chest, and it appears there is a mediastinal shift to the right as well.
Patient: What does that mean, doc?
Doctor: The absence of breath sounds on the right side of your chest could indicate a problem with your lungs, and the mediastinal shift to the right may be related to that issue. We need to investigate this further and find out the cause of your chest pain. I recommend scheduling some tests as soon as possible.
Patient: Oh, okay. What tests do you recommend?
Doctor: We'll start with a chest X-ray and some blood tests to get a better understanding of the underlying cause. Based on the results, we may need to perform additional tests or start treatment.
Patient: I understand. I'll schedule the tests as soon as I can.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to the ophthalmology clinic today with a complaint of acute onset right eye pain with extra-ocular movement. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having right eye periorbital swelling, redness, and my upper right lid is drooping. I've also been experiencing bilateral tearing.
Doctor: I understand. When did these symptoms start?
Patient: They began about 24 hours ago, right after I received my first zoledronic acid infusion for osteoporosis.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. Based on your past medical history, I see that you have chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. You've been on cyclosporine 75 mg daily and monthly belimumab 120 mg/1.5 ml for your rheumatologic conditions for 3 years prior to this presentation, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Let's discuss your ophthalmic exam results. Your best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25–2 in the right eye and 20/25–3 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye. The external exam of your right eye showed mild upper lid edema, erythema, ptosis, and a -1 adduction defect. Do you know what a slit lamp examination is?
Patient: I'm not sure, can you explain?
Doctor: Sure, a slit lamp examination allows us to take a closer look at the structures of your eye. In your case, we found conjunctival chemosis, which is swelling of the eye's outer surface, but no issues with the anterior chamber or any flare. Additionally, the posterior segment exam showed that you have posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in both eyes.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also attempted 24–2 visual field testing, but it wasn't reliable due to frequent fixation loss caused by your eye pain. Based on your symptoms and history, we ordered a contrast-enhanced MRI which showed ill-defined right orbital soft tissue thickening and enhancement in the retro-orbital intraconal space with extension along the retro-orbital scleral contour and surrounding the anterior optic nerve sheath.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Considering your rheumatologic history, we initially thought it could be orbital inflammation secondary to your lupus. However, based on the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and the timing of your symptoms in relation to your zoledronic acid infusion, we suspect that your orbital inflammation might be secondary to bisphosphonate therapy.
Patient: Oh, okay. So, what do we do now?
Doctor: We will start you on oral medications to manage the inflammation and monitor your symptoms closely. We will also keep in touch with your rheumatologist to ensure the best course of action for your treatment. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve, please return to the clinic immediately.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a known case of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus, presented with acute onset right eye pain, periorbital swelling, redness, ptosis of the upper right lid, and bilateral tearing.

O: On examination, the patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25–2 in the right eye and 20/25–3 in the left eye.

MRI of the orbit showed ill-defined right orbital soft tissue thickening and enhancement in the retro-orbital intraconal space with extension along the retro-orbital scleral contour and surrounding the anterior optic nerve sheath.
A: The primary diagnosis is suspected orbital inflammation secondary to bisphosphonate therapy, given the temporal association with zoledronic acid infusion and MRI findings. Differential diagnosis includes orbital inflammation secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, although less likely due to the specific timing and MRI characteristics.
P: Initiate treatment with oral medications to manage the inflammation. Close monitoring of symptoms is advised, with instructions to return to the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve.

Doctor: I see. Have you had any recent symptoms of infections, trauma, or accidents?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those.
Doctor: Okay, let's discuss your past medical history. Do you have any family history of significant concern?
Patient: No, my family history is clear.
Doctor: Are you a non-smoker and teetotaler? And have you been exposed to any environmental factors such as industrial chemicals, radiation, heavy metals, or any toxin exposures?
Patient: Yes, I am a non-smoker and teetotaler. I haven't been exposed to any harmful substances like that.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Moving on, you mentioned that you lead an active life and used to live with your partner. Your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 1 before admission. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: On your examination, we found symmetrical lower limb motor weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern with Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle power 4/5 both proximally and distally. We also observed reduced sensations in your lower limbs symmetrically to fine touch, pinprick, temperature, and proprioception, which progressed to significant sensory loss over the next couple of weeks. Your sensory level is slightly below the umbilicus at T11. However, there was no spinal tenderness. Do you have any questions so far?
Patient: No, I understand. Thank you for explaining.
Doctor: Additionally, your deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were exaggerated with extensor plantar responses. The rest of your general and systemic examination was unremarkable. We conducted blood tests, including full blood count, inflammatory markers, B12, folate, thyroid functions, calcium, liver function test, and myeloma screen, which all came back normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on the second day after admission was also normal with normal protein, glucose, and cytology, etc. Have you had any concerns about these tests?
Patient: No, I'm glad everything was normal.
Doctor: Finally, we evaluated you with a non-contrast MRI spine, which showed focal myelopathic cord signal at the conus and at the level of T10 and T11 vertebrae. The radiological differential diagnosis on MRI includes B12 deficiency, inflammatory, or infection-related causes. We will continue to investigate and monitor your condition closely. It's important that you follow up with us as needed and adhere to any recommendations we provide. Do you have any questions or concerns?
Patient: No, I appreciate all the information. I'll be sure to follow your recommendations. Thank you, doctor.

I haven't been exposed to any harmful substances like that.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Moving on, you mentioned that you lead an active life and used to live with your partner. Your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 1 before admission. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: On your examination, we found symmetrical lower limb motor weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern with Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle power 4/5 both proximally and distally. We also observed reduced sensations in your lower limbs symmetrically to fine touch, pinprick, temperature, and proprioception, which progressed to significant sensory loss over the next couple of weeks. Your sensory level is slightly below the umbilicus at T11. However, there was no spinal tenderness. Do you have any questions so far?\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for explaining.\nDoctor: Additionally, your deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were exaggerated with extensor plantar responses. The rest of your general and systemic examination was unremarkable. We conducted blood tests, including full blood count, inflammatory markers, B12, folate, thyroid functions, calcium, liver function test, and myeloma screen, which all came back normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on the second day after admission was also normal with normal protein, glucose, and cytology, etc. Have you had any concerns about these tests?\nPatient: No, I'm glad everything was normal.\nDoctor: Finally, we evaluated you with a non-contrast MRI spine, which showed focal myelopathic cord signal at the conus and at the level of T10 and T11 vertebrae. The radiological differential diagnosis on MRI includes B12 deficiency, inflammatory, or infection-related causes. We will continue to investigate and monitor your condition closely. It's important that you follow up with us as needed and adhere to any recommendations we provide. Do you have any questions or concerns?\nPatient: No, I appreciate all the information. I'll be sure to follow your recommendations. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to work together to manage your symptoms and find the best course of treatment for you. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.""}

Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your family mentioned you have a history of polysubstance use, including cannabis, nicotine, and alcohol. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yeah, I've used those substances before.
Doctor: When you came into the emergency room, you seemed agitated and unresponsive to verbal redirection. Were you under the influence of any substances at that time?
Patient: I had smoked an unknown amount of marijuana and took one pill of ecstasy about 12-15 hours earlier.
Doctor: Your family reported that they had never seen you in such a state before. Your sister mentioned that prior to the ER visit, you displayed uncontrollable aggression and even damaged furniture at home. Can you recall what triggered this behavior?
Patient: I don't know, doc. I just got really angry and lost control.
Doctor: Your sister also mentioned that you left home early in the morning in a fit of rage and she found you later banging on the glass windows of a pharmacy with a book. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yeah, I was so angry and confused.
Doctor: It seems you experienced an episode of psychosis with a fixation on a recently read fictitious character, leading to suicidal ideation. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: I don't know why, but I became obsessed with this character and started thinking about ending my life.
Doctor: Your sister provided more details about your past trauma. You lived with an alcohol-dependent father and were a victim of racial abuse and physical assault. This has led to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a protectionist savior complex. Does that sound accurate?
Patient: Yeah, that's true. I've been through a lot.
Doctor: When you were in the ER, you refused to provide blood and urine samples for toxicology screening. Is there a reason why?
Patient: I just didn't want to do it at that time. I was too agitated.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having some difficulty breathing and mild chest pressure for about a week now. It reminds me of the symptoms I had when I had a pulmonary embolism more than 10 years ago.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of peripartum cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation, and hypertension.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Were you referred to the emergency department due to your severely elevated blood pressure?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Have you been taking any medications to manage your hypertension?
Patient: I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but I stopped taking it three days ago because it was causing increased urinary frequency. I've been maintaining compliance with losartan, though.
Doctor: Okay, let's go over your vital signs at presentation. Your temperature was 37.2 °C, BP was 218/150, heart rate 121, respiratory rate 16, and pulse oximetry was 100% on room air. Upon examination, your lungs were clear to auscultation, and you had no S3, jugular vein distention, or lower extremity edema. The remainder of your physical exam was unremarkable.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: We also conducted some further tests, including labs, an electrocardiogram (EKG), a chest radiograph, and a bedside echocardiogram (BSE) performed by ultrasound trained EPs. Your initial troponin levels were mildly elevated at 0.08 µg/L, but they down-trended to 0.05 µg/L.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Mildly elevated troponin levels could indicate some stress on your heart, but it's a good sign that they are decreasing. Your chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vasculature. Additionally, your EKG revealed a new left bundle branch block (LBBB).
Patient: And what about the echocardiogram?
Doctor: During your initial BSE, your blood pressure was 252/163, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 170, and your peak longitudinal strain (PLS) was -3.5%. The ejection fraction (EF) was not calculated, but it was estimated to be mildly reduced. Six hours later, your blood pressure improved to 171/94 (MAP = 123), and we performed a repeat BSE with a recalculated PLS.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doc?
Doctor: We'll closely monitor your blood pressure, heart function, and strain. It's important for you to continue taking your losartan and discuss with your primary care doctor about potentially restarting hydrochlorothiazide or considering alternative medications to manage your hypertension. Regular follow-up appointments and monitoring of your symptoms will be necessary to ensure your condition remains stable.
Patient: Alright, thank you for the information and guidance.
Doctor: You're welcome. Make sure to reach out if you have any further concerns or if your symptoms worsen.

"Doctor: Good morning, Mr. Tanaka. I see from your medical history that you have hypertension, dyslipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. Can you tell me about any symptoms you're experiencing?
Patient: Good morning, Doctor. I've been experiencing some chest discomfort and shortness of breath lately.
Doctor: I understand. When you were 71, you had a successful endovascular treatment for your occlusive right common iliac artery. At that time, we performed transthoracic echocardiography for screening, which revealed a dilated aortic root with a width of 49 mm. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I remember.
Doctor: We also did an electrocardiogram-gated cardiac computed tomography (EG-CT) that revealed two sinus of Valsalva aneurysms (SVAs) in both the left and right coronary sinuses, with no obstruction to surrounding cardiac structures. The sizes of the SVAs were 27.2 mm and 33.1 mm for the left and right sides, respectively. Due to their relatively small size, we decided to observe them carefully for 5 years. 
Patient: Right, I've been coming in for regular check-ups.
Doctor: I appreciate your diligence. In your recent follow-up EG-CT, we noticed that the sizes of the SVAs had grown to 34.5 mm and 35.7 mm, respectively. The transthoracic echocardiography also showed moderate aortic regurgitation. The SVA in the left coronary sinus has grown between the pulmonary artery and the left atrium, bulging out on the anterior surface of the heart. The SVA in the right coronary sinus has also grown, pressing the right ventricular outflow tract.
Patient: That doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We concluded that both SVAs are extracardiac, meaning they're expanding on the surface of the heart. This type has a relatively high risk of rupture, which could be life-threatening. Given this situation, I recommend that you undergo surgery for SVA removal. 
Patient: I see. What does the surgery involve?
Doctor: The operation will be performed via median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. After inducing cardioplegic arrest, we will transect the ascending aorta just above the sinotubular junction. Upon inspecting the interior of the aortic root, we will remove the SVAs and repair the affected areas. 
Patient: I understand. I'm willing to provide my informed consent for the surgery.
Doctor: Thank you for your trust in us, Mr. Tanaka. We will do our best to ensure a successful surgery and follow-up care.","S: Mr. Tanaka, a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease, reports experiencing chest discomfort and shortness of breath.

"Doctor: Hi, I see that you've presented to the emergency room with a complaint of a severe headache for 1 day. Can you tell me more about your headache?
Patient: Yes, it's been a throbbing headache with photophobia, and I've had multiple episodes of nonbloody vomiting.
Doctor: I see. You've reported a history of closed head trauma and intermittent rhinorrhea, especially when leaning forward, which resolved a few months prior to this presentation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: You also mentioned a history of intermittent migraines and coronary artery disease. Is there anything else I should be aware of?
Patient: No, I think that's everything.
Doctor: Okay, let's discuss your physical examination. You had photophobia, but no nuchal rigidity or focal motor or sensory neurological deficits were found. Your vital signs were also unremarkable. We did some laboratory tests and found that your hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dl, your white cell count (WBC) was 13.1 × 10^9/1 with 84.7% neutrophils, serum sodium was 138 mEq/l, potassium was 4.1 mEq/l, and creatinine was 0.7 mg/dl. All your liver function tests were within normal limits.
Patient: Okay, that's good to know.
Doctor: We admitted you to the medical floor and performed a lumbar puncture. The opening pressure was 35 cm H2O, and the CSF fluid analysis showed a WBC of 1850 cells/uL with 70% segmental, red blood cells at 5, protein at 175 mg/dl which is higher than the normal range of 15-45 mg/dl, and glucose at 40 mg/dl which is within the normal range of 40-70 mg/dl. The cryptococcal CSF antigen was detected with a titer of 1 : 1024, which is higher than the normal range of < 1 : 2 titer. Your bacterial antigen was negative, and there was no growth on bacterial CSF culture.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also checked your HIV serology, which came back negative, confirmed by nondetectable HIV RNA and an absolute CD4 count of 1168.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: Given your history and suspicion for a traumatic CSF leak, we did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your head and sinus, but they were both unrevealing. Due to the low sensitivity of a regular MRI in diagnosing CSF leaks, we performed a computed tomography (CT) cisternogram.
Patient: And what did that show?
Doctor: The CT cisternogram revealed evidence of leakage of intrathecally injected contrast, confirming a CSF leak.
Patient: So what does that mean for me, doctor?
Doctor: It means that we have identified the cause of your symptoms, and we will now work on a treatment plan to address the CSF leak and manage your headaches. We'll monitor your progress closely and adjust the plan as needed.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.","S: The patient, a known case of coronary artery disease and intermittent migraines, presented with a severe, throbbing headache and photophobia, accompanied by multiple episodes of nonbloody vomiting lasting for one day.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented to our pancreas multidisciplinary clinic. What seems to be the issue?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. For the past 2 months, I've been experiencing some generalized bloating and epigastric discomfort.
Doctor: I see. In that case, we should perform a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a better look at what might be causing your symptoms. 
(After the CT scan)
Doctor: Your CT scan results have come back, and they demonstrated an 11.2 × 9.6 cm heterogeneous solid appearing mass in the tail of your pancreas. The mass has several small peripheral calcifications and lobulated contours abutting your spleen, stomach, and splenic flexure of colon. However, there doesn't seem to be any direct invasion.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What do we do now?
Doctor: We will need to perform a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with splenic artery lymph node dissection to remove the mass.
(After the surgery)
Doctor: The surgery went well. Intraoperatively, we observed a large soft lobular cystic mass at the pancreatic tail. The mass was locally contained without any obvious invasion of surrounding structures or gross metastasis. We sent it for histopathological assessment.
Patient: What were the results of the assessment?
Doctor: The assessment established it as a pT3pN0pMx SPNP (CD56pos nuclear β-cateninpos chromograninneg and synaptophysinneg). Margins were negative, and there was no lymphovascular or perineural invasion. You'll be discharged home after a period of convalescence in the hospital.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.
(Four years later)
Doctor: I see you've been referred back to our clinic after a biopsy-proven recurrence in the splenic fossa. We will need to perform additional surgery to remove the tumor.
Patient: What will the surgery involve?
Doctor: We'll need to perform a wedge gastrectomy and partial colectomy to resect the tumor, as it is densely adherent to the splenic flexure and gastric fundus. Additionally, we'll remove a 4 cm nodule of tumor adherent to the diaphragm and omentum.
(After the surgery)
Doctor: The surgery was successful, but the tumor was soft, extremely friable, and fractured with minimal manipulation. It remained densely adherent to the left diaphragm, left kidney, and left adrenal gland. We were able to dissect down through the Gerota's fat and strip the anterior capsule of the kidney clean to remove the tumor from the kidney and adrenal gland. We also removed the other end of the mass, which was adherent to the diaphragm, along with a portion of the diaphragm.
Patient: What does the pathology report say?
Doctor: The final pathology report confirmed the presence of recurrent metastatic SPNP in your omentum, diaphragm, and accessory spleen. We'll continue to monitor your condition closely.
Patient: Thank you for your help, Doctor.","S: The patient, initially presenting with generalized bloating and epigastric discomfort for 2 months, was diagnosed with a solid pancreatic mass.

"Doctor: Good morning, I see that you're here today to discuss your current psychiatric condition. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yeah, well, I've had these obsessive thoughts and compulsive avoidance acts since I was 14. But back then, I knew they were just a product of my own mind, and I could live a mostly normal life.
Doctor: I understand that there was a sudden exacerbation of your symptoms in May 2016 when you were 19. What happened around that time?
Patient: After my final exams in high school, I tried cannabis five times, and then my symptoms got worse. I started having more severe obsessive thoughts, like I could hurt someone or even myself, and I had these involuntary obscene thoughts.
Doctor: Did you continue to recognize that these thoughts were a product of your own mind?
Patient: Yes, I fought those thoughts and continued to recognize their origin. But I also started experiencing hallucinations, like hearing voices and seeing optical distortions, like the shape of leaves appearing weird.
Doctor: It sounds like you've been dealing with a complex psychiatric syndrome, including obsessive-compulsive, schizophreniform, and derealization phenotypes. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as anxiety or agitation?
Patient: Yeah, I developed diffuse anxiety and agitation, and I've had extreme dizziness, as if I've drunk five beers.
Doctor: I see. Have you been feeling down or having any suicidal thoughts?
Patient: Yes, I've had a depressed mood and suicidal ideation. I've also been having difficulty falling asleep and reduced energy levels, especially in the morning.
Doctor: Due to the severity of these symptoms, I understand that you were hospitalized at age 19. You received pharmacological treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the obsessive-compulsive symptoms, such as citalopram up to 40 mg/day. How did that work for you?
Patient: It helped a bit, but not entirely.
Doctor: You also received neuroleptics for the schizophreniform symptoms, like olanzapine up to 20 mg/day, risperidone up to 5 mg/day, and aripiprazole up to 7.5 mg/day. However, I see that higher doses led to an increase in inner restlessness. Is that correct?
Patient: Yeah, that's right.
Doctor: Lastly, you were prescribed carbamazepine for neuronal network stabilization up to 500 mg. How has that been working for you?
Patient: It's been helpful, but I'm still struggling with some symptoms.
Doctor: I understand. It's important that we continue to monitor and adjust your treatment plan as needed to help manage your complex psychiatric syndrome.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 30-year-old female with a history of intermittent jaundice for the last six years. Can you tell me more about when this jaundice occurs and how it affects you?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Yes, I've had episodes of jaundice during each of my pregnancies. I'm fourth gravida, with one live issue after a fourth-degree consanguineous marriage. The jaundice usually starts in the late second trimester and subsides slowly over two to three months after delivery. Between pregnancies, I have minimal or no jaundice.
Doctor: I see. And during these years, have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain?
Patient: No, doctor. I've been mostly asymptomatic, except for the jaundice. I don't have a history of fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain. I'm also a non-alcoholic and a non-smoker.
Doctor: That's helpful information. Do you have any history of blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse, chronic drug intake, or exposure to occupational hazards?
Patient: No, I don't have any history of those things.
Doctor: Thank you for providing this information. Now, regarding your bilirubin levels, your pre-pregnancy levels were in the range of 3.0-4.0 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal value of 0.1-1.2 mg/dL. During the second trimester of each pregnancy, these levels would rise to about 11.0-12.0 mg/dL. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: It appears that you typically have isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with conjugated bilirubin levels rising to as high as 8.0 to 10.0 mg/dL, while unconjugated bilirubin remains in the range of 2.0-3.0 mg/dL. Your liver function test has always been normal, with serum transaminase levels less than 20 IU/L and serum bile acid levels and proteins within the normal range. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Given the absence of pruritus and normal bile acid levels and serum transaminases, we can exclude the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no associated gestational hypertension or proteinuria. Your hemogram is unremarkable, and your peripheral smear has never shown any evidence of hemolysis. Therefore, thrombotic microangiopathies have also been ruled out. Have you ever had an ultrasound of your abdomen?
Patient: Yes, I had an ultrasound, and it showed a normal liver span and echotexture.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Lastly, have you been tested for viral markers related to hepatitis during your pregnancies?
Patient: Yes, I have, and the tests have always come back negative.
Doctor: Thank you for all this information. It seems that most common causes of jaundice during pregnancy have been ruled out. We will continue to monitor your bilirubin levels and liver function, and I will discuss your case with other specialists to determine the best course of action for your future pregnancies. Please make sure to schedule regular check-ups throughout your pregnancy and follow any further recommendations we may have.","S: 30-year-old female patient presents with a history of intermittent jaundice over the last six years, occurring during each of her pregnancies, typically starting in the late second trimester and subsiding post-delivery. She reports being asymptomatic between episodes, with no history of fever, pruritus, malaise, abdominal pain, blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse, chronic drug intake, or exposure to occupational hazards. She is a non-alcoholic and non-smoker.
O: Patient's pre-pregnancy bilirubin levels were 3.0-4.0 mg/dL (normal 0.1-1.2 mg/dL), rising to 11.0-12.0 mg/dL during pregnancy with conjugated bilirubin levels of 8.0-10.0 mg/dL and unconjugated bilirubin of 2.0-3.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests normal, with serum transaminase levels <20 IU/L, and normal serum bile acid levels and proteins. Ultrasound showed normal liver span and echotexture. Viral markers for hepatitis were negative.
A: The patient exhibits recurrent pregnancy-related conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with normal liver function and structure.

Can you tell me more about when this jaundice occurs and how it affects you?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. Yes, I've had episodes of jaundice during each of my pregnancies. I'm fourth gravida, with one live issue after a fourth-degree consanguineous marriage. The jaundice usually starts in the late second trimester and subsides slowly over two to three months after delivery. Between pregnancies, I have minimal or no jaundice.\nDoctor: I see. And during these years, have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain?\nPatient: No, doctor. I've been mostly asymptomatic, except for the jaundice. I don't have a history of fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain. I'm also a non-alcoholic and a non-smoker.\nDoctor: That's helpful information. Do you have any history of blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse, chronic drug intake, or exposure to occupational hazards?\nPatient: No, I don't have any history of those things.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing this information. Now, regarding your bilirubin levels, your pre-pregnancy levels were in the range of 3.0-4.0 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal value of 0.1-1.2 mg/dL. During the second trimester of each pregnancy, these levels would rise to about 11.0-12.0 mg/dL. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It appears that you typically have isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with conjugated bilirubin levels rising to as high as 8.0 to 10.0 mg/dL, while unconjugated bilirubin remains in the range of 2.0-3.0 mg/dL. Your liver function test has always been normal, with serum transaminase levels less than 20 IU/L and serum bile acid levels and proteins within the normal range. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Given the absence of pruritus and normal bile acid levels and serum transaminases, we can exclude the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no associated gestational hypertension or proteinuria. Your hemogram is unremarkable, and your peripheral smear has never shown any evidence of hemolysis. Therefore, thrombotic microangiopathies have also been ruled out. Have you ever had an ultrasound of your abdomen?\nPatient: Yes, I had an ultrasound, and it showed a normal liver span and echotexture.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Lastly, have you been tested for viral markers related to hepatitis during your pregnancies?\nPatient: Yes, I have, and the tests have always come back negative.\nDoctor: Thank you for all this information. It seems that most common causes of jaundice during pregnancy have been ruled out. We will continue to monitor your bilirubin levels and liver function, and I will discuss your case with other specialists to determine the best course of action for your future pregnancies. Please make sure to schedule regular check-ups throughout your pregnancy and follow any further recommendations we may have.""}

"Doctor: Hi, I heard you were referred to our clinic due to sudden visual loss in your right eye. Can you tell me more about what happened?
Patient: Yeah, it happened within 24 hours after a 2-hour airplane flight from Paris to Madrid. It was sudden and painless, but now I can't see well from my right eye.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any medical history we should be aware of?
Patient: I have well-controlled hypercholesterolemia.
Doctor: Alright. Let's check your vision. *After checking* Your best-corrected visual acuity is 20/200 in your right eye and 20/20 in your left eye. There is a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in your right eye, as well as color vision deficiency and scotoma. 
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there's an issue with the nerve response in your right eye, and you're having trouble with color and a blind spot in your vision. Now, let's do a funduscopic examination. *After the exam* I found swelling in your right optic disc, with superonasal flame-shaped hemorrhaging, venous congestion, and tortuosity. 
Patient: Is my left eye okay?
Doctor: Yes, your left eye appears normal, with a cup-to-disc ratio of less than 0.1, suggesting a ""disc-at-risk."" Let's perform a Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) for your right eye. *After FFA* There is late optic-disc staining in your right eye. 
Patient: What about other tests?
Doctor: We conducted cardiac and carotid Doppler ultrasound, autoimmune, and hypercoagulability tests. They were normal, except for slightly raised serum cholesterol levels. We also did a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan that revealed previously unknown white matter lesions. Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with NA-AION associated with cerebral SVD.
Patient: What's the treatment for that?
Doctor: You will need to take aspirin 100 mg daily. *After one year* I understand you've developed visual disturbances in your left eye during a 10-day drive in the French Alps. Let's check your vision again. *After checking* Your BCVA is now 20/200 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left eye.
Patient: What's going on with my left eye now?
Doctor: Upon examination, there is edematous and flame-shaped retinal hemorrhaging at the border of the left ONH, vascular tortuosity, fluorescein leakage during FFA, and severe widespread visual field loss with central-sparing. This suggests a NA-AION in your left eye as well.
Patient: How is my vision now?
Doctor: At the time of publication, your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) remains the same. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust treatment as necessary.","S: The patient, a known case of well-controlled hypercholesterolemia, presented with sudden, painless visual loss in the right eye occurring within 24 hours after a 2-hour flight. The patient later experienced similar symptoms in the left eye during a 10-day drive in the French Alps.
O: Initial examination revealed a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/200 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), color vision deficiency, and scotoma in the right eye. Funduscopic examination showed swelling in the right optic disc, superonasal flame-shaped hemorrhaging, venous congestion, and tortuosity.

It's really painful.\nDoctor: I see. Let's check your vital signs first. Your blood pressure is 159/91 mmHg, heart rate is 77 bpm, body temperature is 36.5°C, respiratory rate is 12/min, and your SpO2 is 100% on ambient air. Those numbers look mostly fine, but your blood pressure is a bit high. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, can you tell me more about your lumbago?\nPatient: Well, it started right after I fell. It's a sharp pain in my lower back, and it's making it difficult to move around.\nDoctor: I understand. We'll perform a Roentgenography and CT scan to get a better look at your lumbar area. Please wait for a moment while we get the results.\n(After the tests)\nDoctor: The results show that you have a compression fracture of your Th12 vertebra. The AIS score is 3, and your RTS is 7.8408, with a Ps of 0.99416.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the fracture is relatively stable, and the injury severity is moderate. Fortunately, conservative therapy is suitable for your condition. We'll provide you with a medical corset to help support your back during the healing process.\nPatient: How long will it take for me to recover?\nDoctor: You'll need to wear the corset for a few weeks, and you should avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities during that time. You'll be discharged on day 17 of your hospitalization. It's important to follow up with your primary care doctor to monitor your progress.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. I'll be careful and follow your advice.\nDoctor: That's great. With proper care and rest, you should fully recover from your injury in about 37 months.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I'm relieved to hear that I'll eventually get better.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns during your recovery, don't hesitate to reach out to your primary care doctor or come back to the ER. Take care and get well soon.\nPatient: Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate your help.""}

Doctor: I see. Let me take a look at your past medical history. It says here that you have a history of secondary infertility for four years and have one child aged eight years. You were also a candidate for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) protocol due to tubal factors. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: During your first cycle of ovarian stimulation, you were prescribed metformin and Gonal-f 75 IU for six days and then continued for two days. Unfortunately, the cycle was cancelled due to a poor response after the second month. It was then that you started to suffer from gradual abdominal distention, is that right?
Patient: Yes, that's when it started.
Doctor: After that, you were under outpatient care and supportive treatment with a possible diagnosis of hyperstimulation syndrome. They prescribed antagonist GnRH for two days. At your next delayed month visit, they considered the probability of hyperthyroidism and you received gonadotropin hormone agonist (Decapeptyl). However, you were re-evaluated due to being unresponsive to treatment within this period. Is that all correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: It seems that trans-abdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography were performed and showed multiple multiloculated cystic masses with predominantly solid components in both adnexa. Cross-sectional CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging suggested ovarian neoplasm, and they also detected massive peritoneal and pleural effusion. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: Four months after management of hyperstimulation syndrome, due to persistent large ovarian mass and increased tumor marker inhibin more than 3000 pg/mL, you were referred to our oncology department. During your physical examination, they demonstrated enlarged masses extended up to the hypogastric region, which resembled 36 weeks of pregnancy. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what happened.
Doctor: An exploratory laparotomy was performed, which showed massive ascites fluid and multi solid cystic masses in both ovaries extended up to the Xiphoid. They performed a complete resection of the tumor. The pathology report of the frozen section was unable to confirm malignancy, but permanent histology indicated tumor cells with round-to-ovoid nuclei and eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm. Is that what you were informed?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: Based on your history and the results of your tests, we will continue to monitor and manage your condition in our oncology department. We'll make sure to provide the best possible care and keep you informed of any updates or changes in your treatment plan.

The patient has a history of secondary infertility for four years and has been a candidate for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) due to tubal factors. The patient was prescribed metformin and Gonal-l 75 IU for six days and then continued for two days, cancelled due to a poor response after the second month. The patient was then under outpatient care and supportive treatment with GnRH for two days, re-evaluated at the next delayed month visit due to persistent ovarian mass and increased tumor marker inhibin more than 3000 pg/mL.
O: Physical examination revealed enlarged masses extending up to the hypogastric region, resembling 36 weeks of pregnancy. Trans-abdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography showed multiple multiloculated cystic masses with predominantly solid components in both adnexa. Cross-sectional CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging suggested ovarian neoplasm and massive peritoneal and pleural effusion. Histology of the frozen section indicated tumor cells with round-to-ovoid nuclei and eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm.
A: The primary diagnosis is tumor of the adnexa. The patient has a history of secondary infertility and has been a candidate for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) due to tubal factors. The patient's persistent ovarian mass and increased tumor marker inhibin have been identified as contributing to the patient's symptoms.

The patient will be informed of any updates or changes in the treatment plan. The patient is encouraged to report any new symptoms or concerns to the oncology department. "
"Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 65-year-old male with a history of colitis ulcerosa and advanced sarcoidosis, diagnosed 10 years ago. You're currently on oral steroids. What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing exertional dyspnea and right ventricular heart failure symptoms for the last 12 months. It's been progressing, and now I'm in functional class IV.
Doctor: I understand. I see that two years ago, you experienced the first severe decompensation of right heart function. At that time, PH was diagnosed on echocardiography. Your RV to LV ratio exceeded one (RV:LV - 39/32 mm), and you had a peak systolic tricuspid regurgitation gradient (TRPG) of 75 mmHg. Your decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of 15 mm indicated significant pressure overload and RV systolic dysfunction. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: A chest computed tomography (CT) back then revealed sarcoidosis progression, but no pulmonary thromboemboli were detected. After typical heart failure treatment with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and an increased steroid dose, you improved and were discharged in WHO functional class II. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: One year later, you had acute dyspnea, worsening of RV function, and unilateral leg swelling. A chest CT at that time showed fresh thrombi in the left segmental upper lobe pulmonary artery. Moreover, acute deep vein thrombosis was detected with lower limb compression ultrasound. Is that when you started long-term oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban?
Patient: Yeah, that's when I started taking it.
Doctor: Now, two years later, you've been referred to our center due to progressive functional deterioration. On admission, you're in WHO functional class IV, with a saturation on room air of 85%, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, those are my current stats.
Doctor: I also see that you have mild peripheral edema present. In your 6-minute walk test, you covered 100 meters with desaturation to 77%. Your plasma natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) concentration is elevated to 6239 pg/ml, which is quite high (normal range is < 125 pg/ml). Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: Your recent echocardiography showed severe RV pressure overload with a TRPG of 95 mmHg, and dilatation of both the right atrium and ventricle. However, your left ventricle morphology and function are preserved. A chest CT scan also showed signs of continued sarcoidosis progression. Is this all correct?
Patient: Yes, doctor. That's what I've been told.
Doctor: Thank you for confirming all this information. We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed. It's important to keep taking your medications as prescribed and attend follow-up appointments to ensure the best possible care. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

I understand that you're also on oral anticoagulant treatment, Warfarin, for pulmonary embolism and have been diagnosed with stage I obesity, with a BMI of 32.4. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I also see here that you have had a right-sided inguinoscrotal hernia permagna for the past 4 years, but you decided not to get it treated. Can you tell me if you've experienced any symptoms related to this during the last three weeks?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having some issues like dysuria, incomplete urinary bladder emptying, and a reduction of the size of the hernia after voiding. I also noticed increased urination after compressing the scrotal area.
Doctor: I see. Your blood test results show that your haemoglobin is 11.3 g/dl, hematocrit is 34.9%, platelet count is 354 × 109/l, and leukocytosis is 13.5 × 109/l. Additionally, your creatinine level is increased at 1.52 mg/dl, with a urea level of 57 mg/dl, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.39. Your urinalysis demonstrated hematuria, a white cell count of 61/hpf, and the presence of Escherichia coli in your urine culture.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Based on these findings, our nephrologist has recommended a surgical evaluation of your hernia. During the physical examination, did you experience any pain or discomfort in your right inguinal and scrotal area, along with swelling in the ipsilateral testicle and scrotum?
Patient: Yes, I did feel pain and discomfort in that area, and there was some swelling too.
Doctor: Your abdomen was also noted to be soft, nontender, and nondistended during the examination. In order to further investigate, we performed a scrotal ultrasound and an abdominal and pelvic CT scan with endovenous contrast. The results revealed a right inguinoscrotal hernia containing the whole urinary bladder and the right pelvic ureter, associated with right hydronephrosis and ipsilateral renal atrophy.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: You will be admitted to the Department of Surgery here at Mantua Hospital for treatment of your right-sided inguinoscrotal hernia. Before the surgical intervention, we will replace your Warfarin therapy with therapeutic low molecular weight heparin to ensure your safety during the procedure.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of Raynaud's phenomenon for 2 years, and weakness in your four extremities for about 2 months. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yes, I've had stiffness in both of my hands in the mornings, and it usually gets better after 20-30 minutes of rubbing. I haven't noticed any joint pain, fever, oral ulceration, alopecia, or rashes though.
Doctor: I see. And you mentioned that 2 months before your admission, you started to feel weakness in both your arms and legs, which aggravated progressively. Can you describe the difficulties you've faced?
Patient: Yes, I've had difficulties squatting or standing up, and even combing my hair. I've also noticed muscle tenderness in my arms and legs, but no difficulty in breathing or swallowing.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. I understand that you were diagnosed with hypothyroid myopathy in a local hospital and have been taking levothyroxine. Has your weakness improved since then?
Patient: Unfortunately, no. My weakness hasn't improved, so I was transferred to your department.
Doctor: I see. Let's discuss your past medical history. You had left glaucoma with retinal detachment and impaired visual sight in 2015, and you were diagnosed with SWS since childhood. You've also been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and have been on regular levothyroxine replacement for several years, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Alright. During your physical examination, we noticed a 12 cm × 12 cm red patch on your left side with an unclear boundary. Your thyroid didn't show any nodules or swelling. Your breathing sounds were clear, and we assessed your muscle strength levels. Your proximal muscle strength in your arms was at level-4, and in your legs, it was at level-3 according to the UK Medical Research Council criteria. The distal strengths were normal, and you had obvious muscle tenderness in your arms and legs. Other neurological examinations were not significant.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: As for laboratory examinations, we found that you had a positive anti-nuclear antibody with a titer of 1:320 (particle pattern), positive anti-recombinant RO-52 (+++), positive weakly anti-nucleosome antibody (+), and negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, we will work on a treatment plan to address your condition. Please continue your levothyroxine for your hypothyroidism and follow up with us for further evaluation and management.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were born in the Dominican Republic and have been living in the United States for the past 20 years. What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been having some issues lately. I've had low-grade fevers with a temperature max of 100.2°F, night sweats, malaise, and fatigue for about 6 weeks now.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any rash, exertional dyspnea, cough, or joint pains?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Have you had any recent travel, sick contacts, or changes in weight and appetite? Any significant occupational, chemical, or animal exposure? Also, do you have any risk factors for HIV?
Patient: No, none of those things apply to me.
Doctor: Alright, let's proceed with a physical examination. *After examination* You are afebrile and have normal vital signs. I did notice a palpable spleen but no other organomegaly. There was no tenderness, guarding, or rigidity. Your chest, cardiovascular, genital, neurologic, and extremities examinations were unremarkable.
Patient: Okay, so what's next?
Doctor: We'll need to conduct some laboratory studies. *After studies* Your leukocyte count is 15,000 × 109/L, and your eosinophil count is 800 cells × 109/L, which is higher than the normal level of less than 500 × 109/L. All other parameters of the complete blood count and differential markers of renal and hepatic function, including serum calcium, are within normal limits.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: We also performed a chest radiograph, which showed no consolidation, effusion, or cardiomegaly. An abdominal ultrasound was done, but it was nondiagnostic. However, abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed the presence of an enlarged spleen measuring 16 × 7 × 6 cm with multiple hypodense lesions. The liver was reported to be normal without any evidence of hepatomegaly. No lymphadenopathy was seen on the imaging studies.
Patient: That doesn't sound good. What could be causing all of this?
Doctor: Your systemic symptoms along with the splenomegaly and multiple hypodense splenic lesions raise high suspicion for a primary hematologic malignancy or a primary splenic tumor. We performed a normal peripheral blood smear and a normal bone marrow examination to investigate further.
Patient: What do the results show?
Doctor: We also conducted a full-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The PET scan showed multiple hypermetabolic splenic lesions with an SUV of 13.0 and no pathologic uptake in any other areas.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We will need to consult with a specialist to determine the best course of action for your treatment. They will be able to provide more information on your condition and the most appropriate options moving forward. We will keep you informed and involved throughout the process.

The patient will be informed of the diagnosis and treatment options, including the possibility of a primary hematologic malignancy or a primary splenic tumor. "
"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I recently had a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy to treat a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. I'm here for a follow-up.
Doctor: I see. How have you been feeling since the surgery?
Patient: In the immediate postoperative period, I developed a pancreatic fluid leak from the tail of my pancreas, and an abdominal drain was placed.
Doctor: Did the leakage stop after the drain was placed?
Patient: Yes, it stopped draining eventually, and the drain was removed.
Doctor: Were there any further complications after the drain removal?
Patient: Actually, yes. A month after the drain removal, a CT scan showed an increase in the size of the rim enhancing fluid collection around the tail of my pancreas.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Did you undergo any further procedures to address this issue?
Patient: Yes, an ERCP was performed for the suspected pancreatic duct leak, and it confirmed a leak from the tail of my pancreas.
Doctor: What was the next step in your treatment?
Patient: The doctor performed an endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy and placed a 5 Fr x 13 cm pancreatic duct stent with internal barbs.
Doctor: Good. And did you have any additional imaging done after that procedure?
Patient: Yes, an EUS showed a well-demarcated, hypoechoic, heterogeneous collection adjacent to the tail of the pancreas, about 6.5 cm in the largest dimension.
Doctor: How was this collection addressed?
Patient: The doctor placed a 15 mm x 10 mm LAMS under endosonographic guidance from my stomach into the fluid collection, and a large amount of pus was drained.
Doctor: It sounds like the procedure was successful. Did you have any follow-up scans to check the progress?
Patient: Yes, a CT scan of my abdomen a month later showed a decrease in the size of the previously demonstrated LUQ rim-enhancing fluid collection.
Doctor: That's a positive sign. Were there any other complications or events following the CT scan?
Patient: Unfortunately, I had a neurological event before the stent could be removed, which led to my current condition.
Doctor: I'm very sorry to hear that. We will continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary support. Please keep us informed of any changes in your health, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.","S: The patient, who recently underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy for a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, reports a postoperative pancreatic fluid leak from the tail of the pancreas, which ceased following the placement and subsequent removal of an abdominal drain.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand that you've been referred for a psychiatric evaluation by your daughter and the hospital staff due to your hallucinations and thoughts of suicide. Can you tell me more about your situation?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I'm a 55-year-old divorced, multiparous Caucasian woman. My hallucinations started about four months ago. At first, I heard a young girl and a rodent in my house. Then I started experiencing visual and tactile hallucinations of scabies crawling out of my skin.
Doctor: I see. And these hallucinations of scabies led you to believe that you had delusional parasitosis?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It got so bad that I began picking at my skin and applying bleach, ammonium-based cleaning products, and scabicidal agents to try to get rid of them. I even have self-inflicted excoriation and burn injuries on my face, extremities, and abdomen because of it.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been very distressing for you. How did your daughter come to the realization that you were experiencing a delusion?
Patient: Well, I thought three men had broken into my home intending to harm me and my daughter. But she realized it was a delusion and brought me to the community hospital for assessment.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important for us to understand the events leading up to your psychiatric evaluation. Have you tried seeking help from dermatologists regarding your parasitic delusions?
Patient: Yes, I have. I even claimed to have proof of parasitic specimens collected from my body that I could see under a magnifying glass, but the dermatologists were unable to confirm my findings.
Doctor: That must have been frustrating. At any point, were you able to communicate with the parasitic delusions?
Patient: Yes, eventually, I started to talk to the scabies because I couldn't get rid of them, and they seemed to acquire personalities.
Doctor: It sounds like you've been through a lot. Can you tell me more about the persecutory delusions and intrusive thoughts you've experienced?
Patient: I've had thoughts that I should swallow objects, but thankfully, I've been able to dissuade myself from doing so.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your concentration, memory, or mood over the past six months?
Patient: Yes, I've had poor concentration, memory loss, and occasional feelings of helplessness, anhedonia, and insomnia. I've even admitted to having thoughts of suicide.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing all this information with me. It's very important for us to fully understand your situation so we can provide the best possible care. We'll work together to find the right treatment plan for you, and I'll be here to support you throughout the process.","S: The patient is a 55-year-old divorced, multiparous Caucasian female presenting with auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations that began four months ago. She reports hearing voices and seeing and feeling scabies crawling out of her skin, leading to self-diagnosed delusional parasitosis. This has resulted in self-inflicted skin excoriations and chemical burns from using bleach and ammonium-based cleaners. She also experiences persecutory delusions, intrusive thoughts of swallowing objects, poor concentration, memory loss, anhedonia, insomnia, and suicidal ideation.

P: The management plan will include initiating antipsychotic medication and considering antidepressants depending on further evaluation. Referral to a dermatologist is advised to address the physical injuries and rule out any underlying dermatological conditions. Psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy, will be beneficial for addressing delusions and depressive symptoms.

I understand that you've been referred for a psychiatric evaluation by your daughter and the hospital staff due to your hallucinations and thoughts of suicide. Can you tell me more about your situation?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I'm a 55-year-old divorced, multiparous Caucasian woman. My hallucinations started about four months ago. At first, I heard a young girl and a rodent in my house. Then I started experiencing visual and tactile hallucinations of scabies crawling out of my skin.\nDoctor: I see. And these hallucinations of scabies led you to believe that you had delusional parasitosis?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. It got so bad that I began picking at my skin and applying bleach, ammonium-based cleaning products, and scabicidal agents to try to get rid of them. I even have self-inflicted excoriation and burn injuries on my face, extremities, and abdomen because of it.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been very distressing for you. How did your daughter come to the realization that you were experiencing a delusion?\nPatient: Well, I thought three men had broken into my home intending to harm me and my daughter. But she realized it was a delusion and brought me to the community hospital for assessment.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important for us to understand the events leading up to your psychiatric evaluation. Have you tried seeking help from dermatologists regarding your parasitic delusions?\nPatient: Yes, I have. I even claimed to have proof of parasitic specimens collected from my body that I could see under a magnifying glass, but the dermatologists were unable to confirm my findings.\nDoctor: That must have been frustrating. At any point, were you able to communicate with the parasitic delusions?\nPatient: Yes, eventually, I started to talk to the scabies because I couldn't get rid of them, and they seemed to acquire personalities.\nDoctor: It sounds like you've been through a lot.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 67-year-old male chronic smoker with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. What brings you in today?
Patient: Yeah, doc. I had a CT scan recently, and they found a lung nodule. They said it might be malignant and now they want to do a biopsy.
Doctor: That's correct. We've admitted you for an imaging guided biopsy of the 1.2 cm left lower lobe lung nodule that was found on your computed tomography scan. It is indeed suspicious for lung malignancy, so we need to investigate further.
Patient: Okay, so what's the plan for this biopsy?
Doctor: We will place you in a prone position and visualize the lung parenchyma in the posterior lateral left chest. Under CT guidance, we'll use a 19-gauge guide to obtain two separate 20-gauge core biopsy specimens from the mass.
Patient: Hmm, sounds a bit complicated. Are there any risks?
Doctor: There's always a small risk of complications, such as hemorrhage. But we'll be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure to ensure your safety.
Patient: Alright, let's do it then.
[After the biopsy procedure]
Doctor: The biopsy went well, and there was no hemorrhage or immediate post-procedure complications. However, towards the end of the procedure, you started complaining of chest pain and became unconscious. We couldn't find any palpable pulses, so we called a code blue and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines.
Patient: Oh my, what happened next?
Doctor: You demonstrated ventricular fibrillation, which responded to defibrillation shock and epinephrine. We performed three cycles of chest compressions, administered one dose of epinephrine, and delivered a shock of 200 J. You were successfully resuscitated and intubated for mechanical ventilation.
Patient: Wow, that sounds intense. What caused all that?
Doctor: A CT scan of the chest after the resuscitation showed development of a small anechoic area in the left cardiac ventricle, consistent with an air embolus. That's likely what caused the sudden onset of chest pain and unconsciousness.
Patient: Oh, I see. How are my vital signs now?
Doctor: Your vital signs recorded at the time were blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and normal oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. You were admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
Patient: Did they find any more problems?
Doctor: A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram didn't reveal any evidence of an air embolus, and no cardiac wall motion abnormalities were noted. You remained hemodynamically stable for 24 hours.
Patient: So, what's next for me?
Doctor: You were successfully weaned off the mechanical ventilator the next day, and you've been discharged home in a stable condition. We'll continue to monitor your progress and provide appropriate follow-up care.
Patient: Thank you, doc. I appreciate all the help.","S: The patient is a 67-year-old male chronic smoker with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Patient: Hi, Doctor. I received a cadaveric renal transplant back in 2012 due to chronic renal failure related to hypertension. I've been having some issues lately and wanted to discuss them with you.
Doctor: I see. Were there any issues with the transplant, like human leukocyte antigen mismatches?
Patient: Yes, there were 2 HLA mismatches. I'm an ex-smoker and was on hemodialysis for four years before the transplant. There were no records of blood transfusions or previous kidney transplantations.
Doctor: What was the cold ischemia time during your transplantation?
Patient: It was 17 hours.
Doctor: Alright. What immunosuppressive regimen were you on for induction and maintenance?
Patient: For induction, I was given Basiliximab. My maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day, mycophenolate, and prednisone.
Doctor: Have you experienced any issues with your renal function since the transplant?
Patient: I developed delayed graft function and needed hemodialysis for a week. Later, I achieved stable renal function. My current serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dl, which translates to an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 55 mL/min/1.73m.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any symptoms or issues recently?
Patient: Four years after the transplant, during a medical follow-up, I presented asymptomatic microscopic non-glomerular hematuria, which was confirmed by the absence of erythrocytic dysmorphism in the phase-contrast microscopy of my urine.
Doctor: How was your physical examination at that time?
Patient: It was normal, but my serum creatinine had increased to 1.7 mg/dL.
Doctor: Did you have any imaging tests done, like a sonogram?
Patient: Yes, a sonogram showed a solid mass on my left native kidney.
Doctor: What imaging technique was used?
Patient: It was done using a 3.5 MHz convex transducer, a CEUS with Sonovue® bolus of 2.4 mL injected using a 20-gauge intravenous cannula, followed by a 10 mL saline flush.
Doctor: How was the examination performed and documented?
Patient: The examination was performed using contrast harmonic imaging at a low mechanical index of 0.1. The images were documented by digitally storing them over 60 seconds in DICOM format.
Doctor: What did the images show?
Patient: The images showed a hypervascular mass in relation to the remaining parenchyma of my native kidney with heterogeneous enhancement and a pseudocapsule sign.
Doctor: Thank you for providing all this information. Based on your history and findings, we will need to conduct further tests and consultations to determine the best course of action for your situation. In the meantime, continue to monitor any changes in your symptoms and keep up with your follow-up appointments.","S: Patient, a former smoker with a history of chronic renal failure secondary to hypertension, underwent a cadaveric renal transplant in 2012. Reports issues post-transplant including delayed graft function requiring temporary hemodialysis. Currently, presents with a history of asymptomatic microscopic non-glomerular hematuria detected four years post-transplant. No recent changes in symptoms reported.
O: Patient's current serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL with an estimated GFR of 55 mL/min/1.73m². Previous serum creatinine was 1.7 mg/dL. Sonogram using a 3.5 MHz convex transducer and CEUS revealed a solid hypervascular mass with heterogeneous enhancement and a pseudocapsule sign on the left native kidney. Immunotherapy includes Basiliximab for induction; maintenance with tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day, mycophenolate, and prednisone.
A: Primary diagnosis is a solid renal mass in the native kidney, likely a renal cell carcinoma given the imaging characteristics. Differential diagnoses include benign kidney tumors or metastatic disease. The history of immunosuppression and renal transplant complicates the clinical picture, increasing the risk for malignancies.
P: Plan to conduct further diagnostic tests including a biopsy of the renal mass to confirm the diagnosis. Continue current immunosuppressive regimen and monitor renal function closely. Schedule follow-up appointments for continuous assessment and adjust treatment as necessary.

I received a cadaveric renal transplant back in 2012 due to chronic renal failure related to hypertension. I've been having some issues lately and wanted to discuss them with you.\nDoctor: I see. Were there any issues with the transplant, like human leukocyte antigen mismatches?\nPatient: Yes, there were 2 HLA mismatches. I'm an ex-smoker and was on hemodialysis for four years before the transplant. There were no records of blood transfusions or previous kidney transplantations.\nDoctor: What was the cold ischemia time during your transplantation?\nPatient: It was 17 hours.\nDoctor: Alright. What immunosuppressive regimen were you on for induction and maintenance?\nPatient: For induction, I was given Basiliximab. My maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day, mycophenolate, and prednisone.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any issues with your renal function since the transplant?\nPatient: I developed delayed graft function and needed hemodialysis for a week. Later, I achieved stable renal function. My current serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dl, which translates to an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 55 mL/min/1.73m.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any symptoms or issues recently?\nPatient: Four years after the transplant, during a medical follow-up, I presented asymptomatic microscopic non-glomerular hematuria, which was confirmed by the absence of erythrocytic dysmorphism in the phase-contrast microscopy of my urine.\nDoctor: How was your physical examination at that time?\nPatient: It was normal, but my serum creatinine had increased to 1.7 mg/dL.\nDoctor: Did you have any imaging tests done, like a sonogram?\nPatient: Yes, a sonogram showed a solid mass on my left native kidney.\nDoctor: What imaging technique was used?\nPatient: It was done using a 3.5 MHz convex transducer, a CEUS with Sonovue® bolus of 2.4 mL injected using a 20-gauge intravenous cannula, followed by a 10 mL saline flush.\nDoctor: How was the examination performed and documented?\nPatient: The examination was performed using contrast harmonic imaging at a low mechanical index of 0.1. The images were documented by digitally storing them over 60 seconds in DICOM format.\nDoctor: What did the images show?\nPatient: The images showed a hypervascular mass in relation to the remaining parenchyma of my native kidney with heterogeneous enhancement and a pseudocapsule sign.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing all this information. Based on your history and findings, we will need to conduct further tests and consultations to determine the best course of action for your situation. In the meantime, continue to monitor any changes in your symptoms and keep up with your follow-up appointments.""}

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I came to the emergency department because I've been having some neck pain recently.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Have you had any issues with your health before?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma when I was 16, after they removed a neck mass. I had chemotherapy and radiation treatment in 1998.
Doctor: I understand. Did the radiation target any specific areas?
Patient: They targeted lymph nodes in my neck, axilla, and behind my sternum to address the cancer and common lymph node drainage areas. But I didn't have any radiation to my face.
Doctor: Alright. Are you in remission now, and are you currently seeing any doctors for your history of Hodgkin lymphoma?
Patient: Yes, I'm in remission now. But no, I'm not following up with anyone for my history of HL.
Doctor: Okay. Do you have any past surgical history, or any family history of cancer, particularly breast or thyroid cancer?
Patient: No notable past surgical history. My maternal great aunt had ovarian cancer, but there's no family history of breast or thyroid cancer.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked? And do you use any drugs or alcohol?
Patient: I used to smoke, but I quit after about 10 years. I don't use drugs or alcohol.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's address your neck pain. We performed a neck CT and found a subcutaneous mass over your mid-clavicle, a breast mass, and multiple nodules in your thyroid gland. The largest nodule measures 1.5 × 1.6 × 2.0 cm. By ultrasound, the breast mass has dimensions of 2.6 × 4.0 × 4.9 cm.
Patient: Oh, that's concerning. What should I do now?
Doctor: We'll have you follow up in breast and thyroid clinics for these findings. A surgical oncologist will examine you further.
Patient: Okay, I'll do that.
[Patient visits the breast and thyroid clinics]
Doctor: How are you feeling today? I see that you followed up with the breast and thyroid clinics as recommended.
Patient: Yes, I did. I told the surgical oncologist that the large breast mass in the right upper-outer quadrant has been there for a year. I wasn't sure about the mass overlying the clavicle, as it didn't cause any symptoms.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let's do a physical examination.
[Doctor performs a physical examination]
Doctor: Based on the examination, you appear well developed and well nourished. Your respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular systems are normal.
Patient: That's a relief. What's the next step?
Doctor: The surgical oncologist will discuss your case and determine the best course of action for you. Please follow their recommendations, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

"Doctor: Hello! I see that you're a 60-year-old African American female here for a follow-up regarding your elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. You have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis, and chronic lower back pain. Your family has a history of arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Have you ever used alcohol or tobacco?
Patient: No, I have never used alcohol or tobacco.
Doctor: Alright. I see that your elevated alkaline phosphatase level was first noticed in 2013, along with some vague abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed hepatic steatosis. Your viral serologies for hepatitis were negative. A gastrointestinal consult was required to determine the need for a liver biopsy. Can you tell me more about the pain you were experiencing?
Patient: Yes, the abdominal pain came and went for about two years. It was quite vague and hard to pinpoint.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I also see that you had some vague chest pain and dyspnea, which prompted an echocardiogram in February 2015. The echocardiogram demonstrated a left ventricle ejection fraction of 44%. Consequently, a left heart catheterization in the following month showed no significant coronary disease, but a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: In July 2015, a Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed suspicious cirrhosis, possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A CT scan was determined to be necessary because of your rising alkaline phosphatase levels without other explainable etiologies, as well as your appetite suppression and the vague abdominal pains you were experiencing. At that time, your weight was 207 lbs (93.89 kg), and you were advised to diet and exercise. 
Patient: Yes, I remember that. I tried my best to follow the advice.
Doctor: After 4 months of continuous symptoms, especially the abdominal pain, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with a liver biopsy in September 2015. The liver biopsy showed coalescing periportal nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation. The chronic and patchy inflammation is representative of granulomatous hepatitis, despite not having elevated transaminases. 
Patient: Oh, I see. So that's what was causing the pain and inflammation.
Doctor: Yes, it appears so. Now, it's important that we continue to monitor your alkaline phosphatase levels and other symptoms. Please make sure to keep up with your diet and exercise regimen, as this can help improve your overall health and potentially alleviate some of your symptoms. 
Patient: Okay, I will do my best. Thank you for explaining everything to me.

She reports a history of vague abdominal pain and denies any use of alcohol or tobacco. The abdominal pain was intermittent and lasted for about two years. She also experienced vague chest pain and dyspnea.\nO: Previous investigations revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase levels first noted in 2013. An abdominal ultrasound indicated hepatic steatosis, and viral serologies for hepatitis were negative. An echocardiogram in February 2015 showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 44%, and a subsequent left heart catheterization revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. A CT scan in July 2015 suggested possible cirrhosis due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy and liver biopsy in September 2015 confirmed coalescing periportal nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation, indicative of granulomatous hepatitis.\nA: The primary diagnosis is granulomatous hepatitis, as evidenced by liver biopsy findings. Differential diagnoses previously considered included hepatic steatosis and potential cirrhosis. The patient's history of vague abdominal and chest pain, along with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, supports the diagnosis. The prognosis depends on ongoing management and monitoring of liver function and related symptoms.\nP: Continue monitoring alkaline phosphatase levels and liver function. The patient should maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen to manage weight and overall health. Regular follow-ups should be scheduled to monitor her condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Education on the importance of diet and exercise in managing her condition should be reinforced.

She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis, and chronic lower back pain. She has no history of alcohol or tobacco use.
O: The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase level was first noted in 2013, along with some vague abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound in February 2015 showed hepatic steatosis. Viral serologies were negative. A gastrointestinal consult was required to determine the need for a liver biopsy. An echocardiogram in February 2015 showed a left ventricle ejection fraction of 44% and a left ventricle ejection fraction of 50%. A CT scan in July 2015 showed suspicious cirrhosis, possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A CT scan in September 2015 showed coalescing periportal nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation. The chronic and patchy inflammation is representative of granulomatous hepatitis, despite not having elevated transaminases.
A: The primary diagnosis is chronic granulomatous hepatitis with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of abdominal pain and dyspnea, but these were ruled out by CT scan and liver biopsy.
P: The management plan includes continued monitoring of liver function and symptoms. The patient is advised to continue the diet and exercise regimen as recommended. Regular follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. The patient is encouraged to report any new symptoms or changes in her condition immediately. "
"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having blurred vision, hyperemia, and pain in my right eye.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any fever, asthenia, anorexia, arthralgia, myalgia, ulcers, abdominal pain, lower back pain, or urinary symptoms?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Okay, based on your symptoms and some tests, we've diagnosed you with bilateral nongranulomatous anterior uveitis without additional complications. We also found that you have hypertension and raised levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein at 2.6 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 96 mm/first hour. Your glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 48 ml/min/1.73m2, and you have hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, leukocyturia, glucosuria, hematuria, non-nephrotic proteinuria, and raised urine β2-microglobulin levels.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What about other infections?
Doctor: We've ruled out Hepatitis B and C, toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Your chest X-ray images are normal, and your angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) levels are normal. You're also negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).
Patient: What about my kidneys?
Doctor: Ultrasound imaging showed that your kidneys are slightly enlarged. We performed a kidney biopsy, which showed diffuse mononuclear cell interstitial infiltrates, consistent with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.
Patient: So, what's the treatment plan?
Doctor: We've prescribed ocular dexamethasone and mydriatics for your eye, as well as oral prednisolone (5 mg/m2/day), amlodipine, and potassium citrate for your other conditions. Your blood pressure, serum creatinine, and tubular function should normalize, and you should be in remission from uveitis within three months.
Patient: What happens after that?
Doctor: Two months after remission, we'll start you on methotrexate (10 mg/m2/week) to prevent recurrent uveitis. You've had two other episodes of recurrent uveitis without renal involvement, one and three years after being diagnosed. We'll adjust the dosage of methotrexate to 12.5 mg/m2/week as needed.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our Department of Operative Dentistry due to pain in your left maxillary lateral incisor. Can you tell me more about the pain?
Patient: Yeah, it's been bothering me for a while. It was treated before, but the pain never really went away.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any pain when tapping on the tooth or any changes in mobility?
Patient: Yes, it does hurt when I tap it, but the mobility seems normal.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. Let's take a closer look. I noticed that the clinical crown of this tooth is wider than the one on the other side, and there's an unusual depression near the gum line. We'll also perform a periodontal examination using a CP 12 periodontal probe.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: The examination revealed a 5 mm isolated probing defect on the palatal aspect, along with a shallow palatogingival groove. We'll also do a cold test using Roeko Endo Frost to check the vitality of your teeth.
Patient: Okay, go ahead.
Doctor: The cold test showed that your lateral incisor is non-vital, while the adjacent central incisor and canine are vital. Radiographically, we found a poorly obturated canal associated with a periapical radiolucency, with a periapical index score of 5. There's also an untreated accessory root with a patent canal.
Patient: Oh, no. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the previous treatment was inadequate, and you have chronic apical periodontitis due to the untreated canal. Our plan is to perform a non-surgical endodontic retreatment to address the issue.
Patient: Alright, what should I expect during the treatment?
Doctor: We'll use 2.5× magnification loupes and an overhead light source from Tao's Optics to ensure precision during the procedure. After administering local anesthesia with Lidocaine 2% and 1:100000 epinephrine, we'll place a rubber dam to isolate the area.
Patient: Okay, that sounds good.
Doctor: We'll then remove the restorative material from the access cavity using a round diamond bur and remove the previous root filling with ProTaper retreatment files. However, we may not be able to find the orifice of the accessory root with this conventional access.
Patient: What happens if you can't find it?
Doctor: We'll do our best, but if we can't locate it, we'll still proceed with the treatment. The main canal will be filled with calcium hydroxide to help promote healing.

"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me what brings you to the emergency room today?
Patient: Hi Doc, I've been having a productive cough and fever for the past 2 weeks. The temperature usually goes as high as 102°F, mostly at night, and I get chills too.
Doctor: I see. Any other symptoms? Has there been any blood in your cough?
Patient: No, just whitish sputum, no blood.
Doctor: Okay, have you seen a doctor about this before?
Patient: Yes, I saw my primary care doctor and they prescribed me 5 days of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for presumed community-acquired pneumonia.
Doctor: Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: I was diagnosed with HIV about 8 months ago. My CD4 lymphocytes count was 121 cells/mm3 and my HIV viral load was 109,720 copies/mL. I've been taking atovaquone for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis and dolutegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide for the HIV. My recent CD4 lymphocyte counts were above 200 and my HIV viral load was 20.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Let's do a physical examination. 
Doctor: I noticed splenomegaly during the examination. We will need to run some blood tests to find out more.
Patient: Okay, Doc.
Doctor: Your blood tests show a hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL and a platelet count of 81,000 × 106. We also performed a Chest X-ray, which showed no infiltrates. We will transfuse 2 units of packed red blood cells to improve your hemoglobin level.
Patient: Alright, thank you.
Doctor: However, your hemoglobin level kept declining and needed repeated pRBCs transfusion. Your platelet levels also dropped, requiring platelet transfusions. Stool occult blood tests were repeatedly negative. Blood cultures were negative too, but you kept spiking fever intermittently, between 100–105°F.
Patient: Oh no, that's concerning. What do we do next?
Doctor: We conducted a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, which revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as hepatosplenomegaly. Further testing showed a ferritin level of 7953 ng/mL, IL-2 receptor alpha interleukin 8592, EBV PCR <100 copies/mL, and CMV PCR negative.
Patient: What does all this mean, Doc?
Doctor: We performed a bone marrow biopsy of the posterior iliac crest, which was consistent with hemophagocytosis. We also did an excisional biopsy of an axillary lymph node, which confirmed HHV-8 associated multicentric Castleman disease.
Patient: So, what's the plan moving forward?
Doctor: We will discuss your case with a team of specialists to determine the best course of treatment for you. We'll keep you informed and involved in the decision-making process.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

"Doctor: Hello, I wanted to discuss your recent diagnosis and treatment plan. You have been diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and have been treated with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the cancer has metastasized, and you now have end-stage lung cancer. 
Patient: Oh no, that's terrible news. What can be done about it?
Doctor: We have been managing your cancer pain with oral opioid therapy. However, the metastasis of the cancer has caused obstructive jaundice and cholangitis, leading to septic shock. We performed an emergent endoscopic biliary stent placement to treat the obstructive jaundice.
Patient: I see. And what about my blood pressure?
Doctor: To maintain your blood pressure, we have been medicating you with a continuous infusion of noradrenaline at 0.2 μg/kg/min through a peripheral vein. However, due to the repeated placement of peripheral venous catheters, it has become difficult to identify adequate peripheral veins for placement and maintenance of indwelling catheters.
Patient: Hmm, that sounds concerning.
Doctor: In addition to this, your congestive heart failure has continued, causing ascites and edema of the lower extremities. You have also been experiencing orthopnea and have been unable to sleep at night. We requested anesthesiologists to secure a reliable venous line for you.
Patient: So, what happened with the anesthesiologists?
Doctor: They checked your groin and thighs but excluded the femoral vein as a candidate for central venous access due to massive edema of the thighs. They attempted to allow you to assume the supine or reverse Trendelenburg position, but these positions caused worsening of your dyspnea. You could only tolerate the sitting position.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been referred to us by an orthodontist to restore your teeth before starting orthodontic treatment. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any pain, discomfort, or medical problems lately?
Patient: No, I don't feel any pain or discomfort, and I don't have any medical problems that I know of.
Doctor: Alright, during the history taking, your response seemed a bit late. Has anyone mentioned concerns about that before?
Patient: No, not really.
Doctor: Okay, from your history, I see that you've had a successful repair of cleft lip and palate. Now, let's discuss your extra-oral examination. We noticed facial asymmetry on the left side, flattening of the nasal bridge, increased intercanthal distance (35 centimeters) which is also known as orbital hypertelorism, and frontal bossing (54 centimeters). We also observed multiple skin lesions on your arms, and right foot and palmar/plantar pits. Were you aware of these issues?
Patient: Yeah, I noticed those, but didn't know what they meant.
Doctor: In the intra-oral examination, we found multiple carious teeth, painless hard swelling in the left side of your mandible, and mild pain on percussion in all the left mandibular posterior teeth. We performed an orthopantomogram (OPG) which showed bilateral radiolucent lesions associated with a partially erupted mandibular second molar teeth. The left mandibular lesion extended up to the ramus of the mandible. Additionally, you have a horizontally impacted maxillary right second molar and congenitally missing second premolars and third molars. 
Patient: Oh, I didn't realize all that was going on in my mouth.
Doctor: We decided to do a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) for a detailed radiological assessment of the mandibular lesions. Accidentally, the CBCT revealed another large lesion associated with the impacted right maxillary second molar, extending up to the right maxillary sinus. The lower left lesion was severely expanded in all directions (buccolingual, anteroposterior, and superoinferior), and we noticed perforations in the buccal and lingual borders of the mandible. 
Patient: That sounds serious. What does it mean?
Doctor: It's definitely concerning, and we'll need to address these issues before moving forward with orthodontic treatment. Lastly, a skull X-ray revealed calcification of the falx cerebri on the posteroanterior view. We'll need to monitor this closely and may need to consult with additional specialists to determine the best course of action.
Patient: Alright, I understand. What are the next steps?
Doctor: We will develop a treatment plan to address the multiple carious teeth and the lesions in your mouth. In the meantime, it's important to maintain good oral hygiene and attend regular dental checkups. We'll also discuss your case with the orthodontist to ensure a coordinated approach to your orthodontic treatment once the necessary dental work is completed.

"Doctor: Hello, I heard you were referred to our division for a mixed ground-glass opacity lesion in your right upper lung. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I'm feeling fine, actually. I haven't noticed any symptoms.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Your good performance status is a positive sign. We did a physical examination and there were no remarkable findings. We also performed a chest computed tomography (CT) which revealed a 34 mm x 20 mm partial solid nodule with spicule formation and pleural indentation at the right S3 (Fig. ). The consolidation tumor ratio was 30%.
Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there is a lesion in your lung, and we need to investigate it further. We conducted a preoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) which showed that the standard uptake value (SUV) of the lesion was 1.9, and there was no suspicious metastasis. 
Patient: That's a relief, I guess.
Doctor: Yes, it's good news that there's no sign of metastasis. We also detected a Kommerell diverticulum at the origin of the left subclavian artery and a right-sided aortic arch through preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) reconstruction (Fig. , ). An echocardiography revealed no cardiac abnormalities.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doc?
Doctor: Considering the lesion might be malignant, we performed a right upper lobectomy. We used a three-port VATS approach with no rib spreading (no soft tissue retractor or direct visualization). We made a 3-cm incision in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) at the anterior axillary line as the main manipulation port, and a 1-cm incision in the seventh ICS at the scapular line as an assisted manipulation port. A 1-cm thoracoscopic port was made in the seventh ICS at the middle axillary line.
Patient: Alright, then what happened?
Doctor: After dividing the interlobar fissure with a linear stapler, we detached and divided the ascending A2, right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV), A1 + A3, and right upper lobe bronchus sequentially. There were no anatomic variations of pulmonary vessels or bronchi (Fig. ). We then histologically confirmed the invasive carcinoma.
Patient: Oh no, that's not good.
Doctor: I understand your concern. We proceeded with a radical mediastinal lymph node dissection to ensure proper treatment. After the routine dissection of the pulmonary ligament lymph node (#9) and the paraesophageal lymph node (#8), we dissected the subcarinal lymph node (#7). It was difficult to expose the left main bronchus, but we managed to complete the procedure.
Patient: What does this mean for my future health, doctor?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your recovery and schedule follow-up appointments to ensure there are no further complications. We will provide you with specific instructions for your post-operative care, and we will be here to support you throughout your recovery.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.","S: The patient was referred for evaluation of a mixed ground-glass opacity lesion in the right upper lung. The patient reports feeling fine and has not noticed any symptoms. There is no history of similar issues or relevant medical conditions mentioned.
O: Physical examination showed no remarkable findings.

Family: No, he was in the front seat but not driving. He was restrained, thankfully.
Doctor: I see. The vehicle he was in was struck head-on. Do you happen to know the speed at the time of the collision?
Family: We were told it was in excess of 79 miles per hour.
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. When your son arrived at the hospital, he was unconscious and not breathing independently. Our team attempted intubation at the scene, but unfortunately, it was unsuccessful.
Family: Oh no... So what happened next?
Doctor: Sadly, your son was pronounced dead soon after arrival to the hospital. Our deepest condolences to your family.
Family: Thank you, Doctor. This is so difficult for us. What were the findings from the radiographs?
Doctor: The radiographs at the time of the incident noted internal decapitation with AO assimilation specifically between the anterior arch of the atlas and the basiocciput. No fractures were noted, including the odontoid process.
Family: Did he have any past medical or surgical history that could have contributed to this?
Doctor: There was no known past medical or surgical history, and the AO assimilation was unknown to your family. The severity of the collision was the primary factor in this tragic outcome.
Family: We had no idea about the AO assimilation. Thank you for explaining everything to us, Doctor.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having progressive walking difficulties and stiffness in my lower limbs since I was 54. It's more pronounced on the left side.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your previous clinical history and family history?
Patient: They are both unremarkable.
Doctor: Okay. Let me perform a neurological examination to better understand your condition. *After examination* I found proximal upper limb weakness (MRC 4/5 on the left side and 3/5 on the right side) and left lower limb weakness (MRC 4/5). Your muscle tone is preserved, but there's hypotrophy of the upper limb-girdle, upper limb proximal muscles, and left lower limb. I also observed a winged scapula on the right side. Spontaneous fasciculations were detected in the proximal segments of your upper limbs.
Patient: Oh, I see. What about sensory impairment or anything with my cerebellum?
Doctor: No sensory impairment was reported, and your cerebellar examination was unremarkable. Your tendon reflexes were normal at the upper limbs, while knee-jerk and ankle-jerk hyperreflexia were present. No Babinski sign was observed, but exhaustible bilateral ankle clone was observed.
Patient: Hmm, and what about bulbar involvement?
Doctor: No bulbar involvement was present. We also conducted routine laboratory tests like blood cell count, blood glucose, vitamin B12, folate, inflammatory parameters, and immunological tests, and everything was in the normal range. HBsAg and anti-HCV and anti-HIV antibodies, as well as thyroid and parathyroid functions, were normal.
Patient: What about any imaging or cerebrospinal fluid analysis?
Doctor: Your brain and spinal cord imaging were normal, as well as the cerebrospinal fluid analysis.
Patient: Did you find anything on the neuropsychological examination?
Doctor: Yes, there was moderate impairment of executive functions like abstraction, critique, working memory, and planning. Abnormal calculation skills were also noted.
Patient: What about the needle electromyography (EMG) and electroneurography (ENG)?
Doctor: The EMG showed mild signs of chronic neurogenic damage on quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and hand dorsal interosseous muscles. Active denervation was detected in the left tibialis anterior, left quadriceps femoris, and right biceps brachii muscles. The ENG demonstrated a reduction of the compound motor action potential (cMAP) amplitude of the right peroneal nerve.
Patient: I see. What do the motor evoked potentials indicate?
Doctor: The motor evoked potentials indicated that there might be an issue with your central motor pathways. We will need to conduct further tests and evaluations to determine the cause of your symptoms and discuss a treatment plan.
Patient: Okay, thank you for the information. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, aged 54, reports progressive walking difficulties and stiffness in the lower limbs, more pronounced on the left side. The patient's clinical and family histories are unremarkable.

EMG indicated mild chronic neurogenic damage and active denervation in specific muscles. ENG showed reduced cMAP amplitude in the right peroneal nerve. Motor evoked potentials suggested issues with central motor pathways.
A: The patient presents with signs suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder, possibly motor neuron disease (MND), given the progressive motor symptoms, neurogenic changes on EMG, and central motor pathway involvement. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of motor weakness and neurodegeneration. The absence of sensory deficits and normal cerebellar findings help narrow the differential.

Patient: Yes, I have the report right here.
Doctor: Great, let me take a look. Hmm, it shows that your blood ammonia level was >300 μg/dL, which is quite high as the normal range is below 80. Your ornithine levels were 71-86 μM/dL, and homocitrulline levels were 510-643 μM/24 hours. Both of these are also above the normal range.
Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Don't worry, we can manage this. I'm going to prescribe you a diet consisting of lactulose, arginine, and protein restriction. This should help in reducing your blood ammonia levels and improving your clinical symptoms.
Patient: Okay, I'll follow the diet. How long should I expect before seeing any improvement?
Doctor: It may take some time, but you should see a reduction in your blood ammonia levels to around 110-140 μg/dL, and you'll likely experience some clinical improvement.
Patient: That's good to hear. I have some more news, I recently found out that I'm pregnant, about 8 weeks along.
Doctor: Congratulations! In that case, we'll need to adjust your dietary protein intake. I'll be increasing it to 1.2-1.3 g/kg/d to ensure proper nutrition for both you and the baby.
Patient: Thank you! I'll make sure to follow the new diet plan.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Let's fast forward a bit. You've had a healthy male infant delivered at 39 weeks' gestation. Congratulations once again!
Patient: Thank you! Was the delivery okay?
Doctor: Yes, the mode of delivery was not disclosed, but during the delivery, your maternal ammonia levels varied from 74 to 215 μg/dL.
Patient: I hope my child will be okay.
Doctor: Upon follow-up at 16 months of age, your child's Bayley Scales showed normal development, which is a good sign. And at age 5, your child had an IQ of 130!

How long should I expect before seeing any improvement?\nDoctor: It may take some time, but you should see a reduction in your blood ammonia levels to around 110-140 μg/dL, and you'll likely experience some clinical improvement.\nPatient: That's good to hear. I have some more news, I recently found out that I'm pregnant, about 8 weeks along.\nDoctor: Congratulations! In that case, we'll need to adjust your dietary protein intake. I'll be increasing it to 1.2-1.3 g/kg/d to ensure proper nutrition for both you and the baby.\nPatient: Thank you! I'll make sure to follow the new diet plan.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. Let's fast forward a bit. You've had a healthy male infant delivered at 39 weeks' gestation. Congratulations once again!\nPatient: Thank you! Was the delivery okay?\nDoctor: Yes, the mode of delivery was not disclosed, but during the delivery, your maternal ammonia levels varied from 74 to 215 μg/dL.\nPatient: I hope my child will be okay.\nDoctor: Upon follow-up at 16 months of age, your child's Bayley Scales showed normal development, which is a good sign. And at age 5, your child had an IQ of 130!\nPatient: That's wonderful news! I'm so relieved to hear that.\nDoctor: I'm glad to see that both you and your child are doing well. Make sure to continue following your prescribed diet and attend regular check-ups to monitor your progress.\nPatient: Thank you so much for your help, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or questions in the future, feel free to reach out. Take care and congratulations once again on your healthy baby.""}

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having abdominal pain for about 2 weeks now, and it's been getting worse. I also noticed some bleeding in my stool.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, fever, or weight loss recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Do you have any personal history of medical or surgical diseases? And is there any history of malignant disease in your family?
Patient: No, I don't have any history of medical or surgical diseases, and there's no history of malignant disease in my family either.
Doctor: Okay, let's do an initial clinical observation. *After examining the patient* You appear to be haemodynamically stable. I can feel a painless mass in your periumbilical region, left hypochondrium, and left flank. There's also evidence of low gastrointestinal bleeding, or hematochezia. We'll need to get some tests done to find the cause.
Patient: Alright, what tests do I need?
Doctor: First, let's check your haemoglobin. *After checking* Your initial haemoglobin value at admission is 133 g/dl. We'll also perform an emergency non-total colonoscopy to look for any gastrointestinal lesions that could cause the bleeding.
Patient: Okay, let me know what you find.
Doctor: *After colonoscopy* We didn't find any lesions during the colonoscopy. We'll need to perform an Angio-CT to get more information. *After Angio-CT* The scan showed a large exophytic mass, approximately 20 x 14 x 13 cm, arising from the 4th duodenal segment and first jejunal segment. It has vascularization provided from branches of the upper mesenteric artery, with vascular dilatations inside the tumor and apparent intratumoral bleeding. However, there's no intraperitoneal bleeding.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What are my options?
Doctor: Unfortunately, your condition has deteriorated, and you've become haemodynamically instable with a new episode of low gastrointestinal bleeding. Your haemoglobin value has dropped to 8.6 g/dl, so we'll need to provide fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion.
Patient: I understand. What's the next step?
Doctor: Due to your haemodynamic instability, we'll need to perform an emergency laparotomy. *After surgery* We found a large tumor arising from the first jejunal segment, 2 cm after the duodenal-jejunal flexure. We performed a segmental enterectomy, resecting the mass and adjacent jejunum and the 4th duodenal segment. A side-to-side manual anastomosis was performed between the 3rd duodenal segment and the jejunum.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The surgery went well, and you're now in the post-operative period. There were no complications, and we'll be monitoring your recovery.
Patient: When can I start eating again?
Doctor: You can start oral feeding on the 7th post-operative day. We'll perform a gastrointestinal oral contrast study to confirm the integrity of the anastomosis before allowing you to eat.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll be here to support you throughout your recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.","S: Patient reports abdominal pain for 2 weeks, worsening over time, accompanied by bleeding in stool (hematochezia).

The patient was discharged on a daily proton pump inhibitor.
O: The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of nausea and vomiting for four days, diagnosed with right-sided, multicentric, infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast, Stage 1A, estrogen positive, human epidermal growth factor negative, and right mastectomy with sentinel lymph nodes negative for metastases. The patient underwent an upper endoscopy 12 weeks later, which revealed esophagitis and gastric stenosis at the pylorus and duodenal bulb, dilated using a through-the-scope controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon. Biopsy of the gastric stenosis revealed gastric mucosa of antral type with minimal chronic active gastritis. The patient was treated with adjuvant anastrozole for five years, with yearly mammograms negative for recurrence.
A: The primary diagnosis is right-sided, multicentric, infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast, Stage 1A, estrogen positive, human epidermal growth factor negative, and right mastectomy with sentinel lymph nodes negative for metastases. The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting improved following balloon dilation.
P: The management plan includes close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and adherence to the prescribed proton pump inhibitor. The patient will continue receiving adjuvant anastrozole and undergo regular follow-up mammograms to ensure no recurrence of the disease. The patient will be educated on the importance of adherence to the treatment plan and the importance of reporting any new or worsening symptoms promptly. "
"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you were diagnosed with infectious cervical tuberculosis on C1 about a year ago, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And you underwent posterior C1-2 screw-plate fixation surgery at a hospital in India. How did you feel after the surgery?
Patient: Initially, my neck pain improved, but over the last nine months, my swallowing function has gradually worsened.
Doctor: I see. You also experienced loss of reduction and progressive dysphagia, along with severe weight loss, right?
Patient: Yes, exactly. I was referred to your hospital because of these issues.
Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. I also see in your medical history that you have hypertension and mild diabetes mellitus, with an HbA1c of 6.2% NGSP. Have you been receiving antitubercular treatment since your diagnosis?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking the prescribed medications from my local hospital.
Doctor: Good to know. Now, let's discuss your current condition. Your height is 165 cm, and your weight is 52 kg, which gives you a BMI of 19. You've lost 25 kg over the past 7 months due to difficulty in swallowing. Are you currently using a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding?
Patient: Yes, I am. It's been helping me get the nutrition I need.
Doctor: That's important for your recovery. During your neurological examination, we found left dominant proximal arm muscle weakness with atrophy, dysesthesia in distal fingers, and hyperreflexia throughout with bilateral extensor plantar reflex. In your oral examination, we noticed left tongue atrophy and left tongue deviation, consistent with unilateral HNP. Your routine blood work showed a slightly elevated level of C reactive protein (CRP), but the other findings were normal. Does this sound accurate to you?
Patient: Yes, that's what I've been told.
Doctor: We also performed a chest X-ray, which showed no specific abnormality. However, the lateral cervical X-ray showed an O-C2 angle of 17-degree kyphosis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an erosive lesion at the dens and anterior arch of the atlas. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in that area?
Patient: Yes, I have. It's been quite bothersome.
Doctor: I can imagine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a space-occupying lesion in the retropharyngeal space, which presented with heterogeneous signals on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Interestingly, a review of your previous imaging studies showed that the lesion has been gradually decreasing in size, despite the progression of O-C kyphosis. 
Patient: Oh, that's good to hear.
Doctor: So, your main problems right now are severe dysphagia and subsequent malnutrition, as well as neck pain. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, it's important to continue using the NG tube for feeding and taking your antitubercular medications.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you.","S: The patient, previously diagnosed with infectious cervical tuberculosis on C1, reports progressive dysphagia and severe weight loss over the past nine months following posterior C1-2 screw-plate fixation surgery.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I have Crouzon syndrome and I've been having multiple episodes of epistaxis in the past few days. I also have nasal obstruction and impaired nasal breathing for the past few months.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any other medical history we should be aware of?
Patient: No, the rest of my medical history is free.
Doctor: Alright, let's start with a clinical examination. *Examines patient* I notice a polypoid lesion protruding from your right nostril, asymmetry of your face, and projection of the ipsilateral canine fossa.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: We'll need to perform a computed tomography of your paranasal sinuses to get a clearer picture of what's going on. *Reviews CT results* The CT shows an inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass that completely occupies your right nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The lesion has caused extensive bone remodeling of your right maxillary sinus with complete absence of its anterior wall, erosion of the posterior wall, and entry of the lesion in the pterygopalatine fossa. There's also erosion of the ipsilateral lower and median orbital wall, and entry of the lesion in the orbital cavity. Despite its large size, the lesion seems to be well-defined without invasive characteristics.
Patient: That sounds serious. What do the laboratory tests say?
Doctor: Your routine laboratory tests are within the normal range. We also had a preoperative maxillofacial consultation, which excluded pathology of odontogenic origin.
Patient: What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We'll have you undergo a biopsy under local anesthesia. *Performs biopsy* The findings show nonspecific inflammation. We'll need to perform open surgery under general anesthesia via lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy.
Patient: Okay, let's do it.
*After surgery*
Doctor: The surgery went well. The maxillary sinus mucosa was completely replaced by inflammatory tissue, which we were able to mobilize and dissect free from surrounding tissues within the orbit and pterygopalatine fossa. There was no macroscopic invasion of any neighboring structures. The histopathological examination revealed typical nasal polyposis with a mixed population of eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages, and no evidence of fungal invasion.
Patient: What's the postoperative treatment?
Doctor: We'll start you on antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment for a short period. You'll also use local nasal mometasone furoate for 2 months after surgery, and we'll administer intensive saline solution irrigations.
Patient: If I follow this treatment, will my symptoms improve?
Doctor: Yes, following this treatment plan should help alleviate your symptoms. Currently, there are no clinical/radiological signs or symptoms of further complications. We'll monitor your progress closely. If you have any concerns or notice any changes, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
