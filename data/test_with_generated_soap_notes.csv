"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Hi, I don't have any past medical history.
Doctor: Okay. What brings you in today?
Patient: I've been experiencing painless blurry vision in my right eye for a week now. I've also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity?
Patient: No, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.
Doctor: Do you work with any toxic substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?
Patient: No, I work as a flooring installer and I don't have any toxic habits.
Doctor: Alright. We checked your vital signs and they were normal. During the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than in your left eye. You also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. We also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. You have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. You also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 33 mm/hr, and your C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at 13.3 mg/L. Your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.
Patient: Okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: These results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. We also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. In the meantime, we'll monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. We'll keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.
Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.","S: The patient reports experiencing painless blurry vision in the right eye for a week, intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the lower legs for the past 6 months. The patient denies any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity.
O: Physical examination revealed bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in the right eye, greater than in the left eye, with a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Muscle strength and reflexes were normal, but sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception were intact. Laboratory results showed microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. Electrolytes were normal, with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L. Urinalysis showed no protein or blood.
A: The primary diagnosis is bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema, likely caused by an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of these symptoms, but they are less likely given the clinical and laboratory findings.
P: The management plan includes further investigation to determine the cause of the symptoms. The patient will be monitored for any new or worsening symptoms and provided supportive care. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 7-year-old boy with congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness, and you've had a failed right cochlear implant. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, doctor.
Doctor: We recently conducted a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) before transferring you to the operating theatre for an ABI insertion. During the MRI, your airway was secured with a size 5.5 mm internal-diameter uncuffed ETT. Did you experience any discomfort during the MRI?
Patient: No, it was okay.
Doctor: Great. Now, during the surgery, we will be performing intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring, which includes brainstem auditory sensory evoked potentials, brainstem mapping of CN IX, X, XI, XII and their motor nuclei, and corticobulbar tract motor-evoked potential (MEP). This will help us monitor your nerves during the procedure.
Patient: Okay, doctor.
Doctor: Our anesthesia team will be responsible for the lead placement for CN IX, X, XI, XII. We will use a 32 mm by 29 mm laryngeal electrode for CN X monitoring (Fig.). To ensure optimal electrode placement on the tracheal tube, we positioned you as intended for surgery (right lateral) and identified the depth of ETT corresponding to the laryngeal inlet using a C-MAC Laryngoscope.
Patient: Hmm, alright.
Doctor: This corresponded to 6 cm at vocal cords (15 cm at lips). We then prepared a new #5.5 uncuffed ETT with the laryngeal electrodes (Fig.) and re-intubated you, in keeping with the measurements. 
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: For CN IX placement, we put a pin electrode on the ipsilateral soft palate. For CN XII, we placed electrodes on the anterior tongue. 
Patient: I see.
Doctor: To stabilize the tracheal tube, we used rolled up gauzes on either side of it (Fig.), which also acted as a bite block.
Patient: Alright, doctor.
Doctor: During the surgery, we will administer Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) which includes propofol (Paedsfusor Target Control Infusion, target plasma concentration 3.5–5.0 mcg/ml) and remifentanil (0.08–0.3 mcg/kg/min).
Patient: Will I feel any pain during the surgery?
Doctor: No, the anesthesia will ensure that you remain comfortable and pain-free throughout the procedure.
Patient: That's good to know.
Doctor: After the surgery, we will closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary follow-up care. It's important that you follow our instructions to ensure the best possible outcome.
Patient: Yes, doctor. I will.
Doctor: Great. If you or your family have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

"Doctor: Hello, we've received your results from the ultrasound we performed in April 2017. It seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. We also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.
Patient: Hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?
Doctor: Your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ng/mL. To further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.
Patient: And what did the stimulation test show?
Doctor: After the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. As a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.
Patient: Yes, I remember that. How was my recovery after the surgery?
Doctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. However, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.
Patient: That's good to hear. What did the tests on the removed tissue show?
Doctor: Immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) measuring 1 cm. It is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.
Patient: What about the other surrounding tissue?
Doctor: Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. However, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.
Patient: That's a relief. What other tests were done on the tissue?
Doctor: To perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high pH. They were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.
Patient: So, what does this all mean for my condition?
Doctor: Overall, these results confirm the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Fortunately, none of the lymph nodes showed signs of metastases, which is a positive sign. It's important to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring to ensure proper management of your condition.","S: The patient reports a single thyroid nodule measuring 1 cm in the left lobe, diagnosed in April 2017.

The patient underwent biochemical screening, including TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin levels, which showed elevated calcitonin. A stimulation test with intravenous calcium indicated significantly elevated calcitonin levels, leading to a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. Post-surgery, the patient experienced transient hypocalcemia but recovered within 48 hours. The patient inquired about the recovery and results of the tissue tests post-surgery.
O: Ultrasound revealed a 1 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. Initial calcitonin level was 40 ng/mL (normal range 1-4.8 ng/mL). Post-stimulation, calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL. Postoperative recovery included slight hypocalcemia, resolving in 48 hours. Immunohistochemistry of the thyroid nodule confirmed medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), 1 cm in size, with cells positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, and negative for amyloid. No lymph node metastases were found. Additional tissue analysis involved antigen retrieval and immunolabeling confirming MTC.
A: The primary diagnosis is medullary thyroid cancer, confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the thyroid nodule and absence of metastasis in lymph nodes. The patient's elevated calcitonin levels and the results of the stimulation test supported the need for surgical intervention, which was successfully performed without complications.
P: The patient will continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any recurrence or progression of medullary thyroid cancer.

It seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. We also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.\nPatient: Hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?\nDoctor: Your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ng/mL. To further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.\nPatient: And what did the stimulation test show?\nDoctor: After the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. As a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. How was my recovery after the surgery?\nDoctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. However, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What did the tests on the removed tissue show?\nDoctor: Immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) measuring 1 cm. It is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.\nPatient: What about the other surrounding tissue?\nDoctor: Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. However, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.\nPatient: That's a relief. What other tests were done on the tissue?\nDoctor: To perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high pH. They were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.\nPatient: So, what does this all mean for my condition?\nDoctor: Overall, these results confirm the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Fortunately, none of the lymph nodes showed signs of metastases, which is a positive sign. It's important to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring to ensure proper management of your condition.""}

"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me what brought you here today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having a progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week. I also noticed some right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia.
Doctor: I see. Let's talk about when you first presented with these symptoms. Did you experience any conscious disturbance?
Patient: Yes, I had an acute onset conscious disturbance, and my Glasgow Coma Scale was E3VaM5 at the hospital.
Doctor: Okay, we performed a brain computed tomography and found an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic changes. The tumor is located in your left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it's a serious condition. We performed an emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in December 2006. The pathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic GBM.
Patient: What happened after that?
Doctor: You underwent radiotherapy a month later, followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for six months. Your performance status improved to a Karnofsky Grade of 70, and your clinical condition was stable thereafter.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: However, a follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in June 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion, about 1.1 cm in diameter, at your left temporal base. The brain MRI in October 2014 showed a progressive change in lesions, with a maximum of 3.0 cm in diameter.
Patient: What did you do about that?
Doctor: We performed another surgery for gross tumor removal. Histologically, the tumors showed the oligodendroglial component. Neoplastic cells also showed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) negativity as revealed by immunostaining.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: During your follow-up, we noticed signs of increased intracranial pressure in May 2015. As a result, you received a third debulking surgery.
Patient: What did the third pathology reveal?
Doctor: The third pathology revealed both GBM- and PNET-like components. In immunohistochemistry, the PNET-like component exhibited positivity for synaptophysin and CD56 and focal weak positivity for glial fibrillary.
Patient: What's the next step for my treatment?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide further treatment options as needed. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure the best possible care.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you have been dealing with hepatocellular carcinoma and had a liver transplantation from a living donor about a year ago. How have you been feeling recently?
Patient: Well, lately I developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day). How has your pain been since then?
Patient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful.
Doctor: I see. In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.
Doctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?
Patient: The patch has been helpful; I've noticed a difference.
Doctor: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 μg/day. We have been gradually decreasing the dose daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day). As your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms. The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms. How are you feeling now?
Patient: I'm feeling much better now, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and let us know if you experience any discomfort or changes in your condition.

Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness were noted upon opioid discontinuation.
O: The patient was initially managed with a continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion, starting at 1200 μg/day and increased to 2400 μg/day based on pain intensity. Following the discontinuation of fentanyl, withdrawal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness occurred. These symptoms resolved upon resuming fentanyl at 240 μg/day. A transdermal fentanyl patch was later used to taper the opioid more gradually. The patient's pancreatitis recurred transiently, requiring resumption and gradual tapering of fentanyl infusion from 600 μg/day to 60 μg/day over several days. The patient reports feeling much better following the complete discontinuation of fentanyl, 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.
A: The primary diagnosis is severe acute pancreatitis post-liver transplantation, complicated by opioid withdrawal symptoms following fentanyl discontinuation. The patient's response to the reintroduction and gradual tapering of fentanyl suggests effective management of withdrawal symptoms.
P: Continue monitoring the patient's symptoms and recovery post-pancreatitis and post-fentanyl discontinuation. Follow-up appointments should be scheduled regularly to assess pain levels, pancreatitis status, and any potential recurrence of symptoms.

We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?\nPatient: The patch has been helpful; I've noticed a difference.\nDoctor: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 μg/day. We have been gradually decreasing the dose daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day). As your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms. The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms. How are you feeling now?\nPatient: I'm feeling much better now, thank you.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. Make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and let us know if you experience any discomfort or changes in your condition. We will continue to follow up with you to ensure your recovery goes smoothly.""}

How have you been feeling recently?\nPatient: Well, lately I developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day). How has your pain been since then?\nPatient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful.\nDoctor: I see.
