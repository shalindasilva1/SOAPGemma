Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\\nPatient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \\n(After the tests)\\nDoctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\\nPatient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\\nDoctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\\nPatient: What does that mean for my son?\\nDoctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\\nPatient: What should we do for follow-up?\\nDoctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We will follow your recommendations and keep an eye on his progress.\""

The physical characteristics and genetic findings suggest a specific syndrome, which needs further correlation with clinical findings and genetic counseling.\\nP: The management plan includes regular follow-up visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist to support the patient's developmental needs and address his attention deficit disorder. Regular medical check-ups will monitor his growth and overall health. Genetic counseling for the family is also recommended to discuss the implications of the genetic findings and potential familial inheritance.\""
