      "Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\n",
      "Patient: My son has been having some issues with speech and development. He's 13 years old now.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\n",
      "Patient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \n",
      "(After the tests)\n",
      "Doctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\n",
      "Patient: What does that mean for my son?\n",
      "Doctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\n",
      "Patient: What should we do for follow-up?\n",
      "Doctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.\n",
      "Patient: Thank you, doctor. We will follow your recommendations and keep an eye on his progress.\n",
      "Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me.\n",
      "\n",
      "S: The patient's son is a 13-year-old boy with speech and developmental delays, attention deficit disorder, and no hypotonia. He presents with retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip, broad and short hands, and mild syndactyly of the second and third toe with a sandal gap in both feet.\n",
      "O: MRI shows no structural brain anomalies. Physical characteristics are consistent with syndactyly and retrognathia. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) revealed a de novo frameshift variant in Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)).\n",
      "A: The likely diagnosis is syndactyly with possible underlying genetic etiology. Differential diagnoses include other genetic conditions with overlapping features. The prognostic outlook is dependent on the specific genetic variant and its impact on protein function. \n",
      "P: Referral to a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist is recommended for ongoing monitoring and support. Regular check-ups with the primary care physician are advised for growth and health monitoring. Genetic counseling may be beneficial to understand the inheritance pattern and implications of the identified variant. \n",
